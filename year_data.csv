		Hello. How may I help you?
	

	Josh  Taylor 01:38:35 pm
	
		Hi Ryan,
	
		For the last few weeks, we have been waiting on a response in regards to pricing and recipes for large batches (frozen mixes)
	

	System 01:50:14 pm
	
		You were transferred to Bweir
	

	Bweir 01:50:59 pm
	
		Hi, Ryan. I'd be happy to help. Let me look up your account.
	
		Ryan, you have a question about creating recipes? Or prep items?
	

	Josh  Taylor 01:56:32 pm
	
		In tools we have drink pricing
	
		Is there a tool for pricing large gallon mixes to single serve 12oz drinks ?
	

	Bweir 01:58:24 pm
	
		Have you looked at the ""create prepared item"" tool?
	
		If you go to your Inventory History, and look at the top right, you can record a prepared item. You can add the ingredients and it will appear in your inventory. Then each time you prep the item you can record it and it will consume the ingredients. When you create a recipe, you can use that prepped item in your ingredients.

		BevSpot Support here! How can we help?
	

	Adam Bruner 12:05:52 pm
	
		Hey Marguerite, so I seem to have an issue with counting inventory today. Today we did two separate inventory counts. One inventory count we did 3 storage areas and then finished the count as a ""partial"". And then we started another count for all the remaining storage areas and marked that as ""partial"" as well and it seems that the first count with didn't not log and is not showing in our total inventory.
	

	Marguerite 12:07:18 pm
	
		Hi Adam! That sounds frustrating. Hopefully we can figure this out together. Let me go into your account now. 
	

	Adam Bruner 12:07:51 pm
	
		Thank you!
	

	Marguerite 12:11:39 pm
	
		I see two partial inventories from today 
	

	Adam Bruner 12:14:44 pm
	
		Yep, those were they two i was refering too. But when I go to cart builder and check the inventory it doesn't show any inventory in the storage spaces I counted first
	

	Marguerite 12:18:46 pm
	
		Let's try making it a regular inventory and not a partial 
	

	Adam Bruner 12:22:45 pm
	
		So we have to redo the entire inventory take?
	

	Marguerite 12:24:25 pm
	
		Nope! 
	
		Just click back into each of the inventories and click the three dots in the right 
	
		Select edit 
	
		and then uncheck the box that says ""Mark as Partial""
	
		If you notice, partial counts wont be calculated in overall usage calculations 
	
		So I would try that and then if it still doesn't work, I'll get someone else in here that may be able to help you better :)
	

	Adam Bruner 12:28:01 pm
	
		Okay one sec let me try that. So i will uncheck partial for both inventory taks?
	

	Marguerite 12:28:13 pm
	
		Yes
	

	Adam Bruner 12:30:12 pm
	
		So I unchecked both of them. And then when I went to cart builder, I'm still seeing no inventory recorded for the first storage areas
	

	Marguerite 12:30:43 pm
	
		Okay, let's see...
	
		I'm going to rope someone else in!
	

	Adam Bruner 12:31:45 pm
	
		Okay thank you

	Adam Bruner 12:42:06 pm
	
		Sure thing
	

	Brad 12:44:45 pm
	
		Adam I am looking at your inventories now. Give me one moment to check a few things
	
		Can you give me a specific item where you see a discrepancy
	

	Adam Bruner 12:47:47 pm
	
		Ame du Vin Rose
	
		When I'm using cart builder, I can see that we have 4 bottles in ""Storage Room - Wine Fridge"" and 4 bottles in ""Wine Wall"" but I don't see the two bottles I counted for ""Main Bar - Left Fridge""

		Hi Laura its Mark from the Canoe Club Wine Bar.  Can you tell me how the Sales Price is calculated?  I was assuming it was coming from the data dowloaded from my Toast input but recently I have noticed it is not because it has not changed when I raised my pricing and in fact stayed the same s it was.  If this is the case then my cost % is incorrect and will have to changed sales prices in Bev Spot manually for each item.
	

	Laura 10:04:24 am
	
		Hi Mark, the Toast report pulls the average price over whatever date range you're looking at (so if you're looking at all of August, which is the default, you're looking at many sales at the old price plus many at the new price). Try customizing the date range to say just the dates since the price was changed, and you'll see the prices are updated.
	
		Are you pulling the Profitability report?
	

	Mark LaGrange 10:06:00 am
	
		I am pulling from the item report down load
	
		see the excel spreadsheet I attached
	
		Look at draft beer at $5.50 sales price.  I charge $6.00
	
		It has not changed from earlier in the year when I used to charge $5.50
	

	Laura 10:08:25 am
	
		This sounds like a more nitty-gritty question than I'm able to help with, I'm going to transfer you to support
	
		One sec!

	kristin moraes 12:01:18 pm
	
		Hi, we started bevspot about a year ago. I was inputting all date into BevSpot until the beginning of the year. We never did a count though. Wondering if I should just start clean or should continue to input everything into BevSpot and do a count this weekend when were closed? What's the easiest way to get this off the ground?
	

	Brad 12:03:15 pm
	
		Hi, Kristin. Did you have any sales during this time?
	
		Or were you temporarily closed?
	

	kristin moraes 12:04:05 pm
	
		Yes, we were open from june 30, 2019 to March 16, 2020 then we closed down until we reopened on june 18, 2020 and has been opened since then
	

	Brad 12:07:14 pm
	
		Kristin, the easiest thing to do would be to just count this weekend. There will probably be some usage variance that's higher than normal, but things should look normal your next count.
	

	kristin moraes 12:10:36 pm
	
		but my question is should i input the rest of vendor invoices since i stopped back in February? so all invoices will be in from we were first opened but our first count won't be until a year later. does that make sense
	

	Brad 12:12:02 pm
	
		I see. Let me talk to one of our CSMs briefly.
	

	kristin moraes 12:12:09 pm
	
		thank you
	

	Brad 12:14:59 pm
	
		Kristin, I think in this case, it might be best to talk with your CSM directly: https://app.hubspot.com/meetings/nick554
	

	kristin moraes 12:17:45 pm
	
		great. thank you
	

	Brad 12:18:11 pm
	
		No, problem. Thank you for using BevSpot!

		Hi from BevSpot Support! Check out our help center at www.bevspot.com/help or chat us here if you have any questions as you move around the software.
	

	Luke Foley 01:04:39 pm
	
		Hi!  Question....when doing inventory the previous inventory's amounts used to show under the item.  This was particularly helpful for us because we have a large whiskey selection and seeing the previous  amount helped to avoid negative discrepancies.  Has this feature been removed?
	

	Matthew 01:06:32 pm
	
		Tyla great question and thank you for being so thorough with the description. I am actually in Sales, I'm going to transfer you to one of my colleagues to check on this for you. Thank you for reaching out on our web chat!
	

	Luke Foley 01:06:50 pm
	
		ok, thank you!

	Brad 01:08:08 pm
	
		Hi, Tyla. Let me look into this for you.
	
		Tyla, I know when you create a new Draft, you can highlight (usage) and get prev totals. I'm not sure if anything has changed, but I can reach out to the product team to check for you.
	
		If you go to the Summary section of your inventory, and click on the total amount, it will show what your last count was per storage area.
	

	Luke Foley 01:15:58 pm
	
		It used to show right under the item description without having to go into another section.  That was very helpful and made the inventory process go much faster.  I am wondering if it has been removed?  Is that something that can be put back on (for lack of a better term!)?
	

	Brad 01:17:18 pm
	
		I am going to forward this to the product team and see if we can put this in our feature request queue. How recently did you notice this change, Tyla?
	

	Luke Foley 01:19:31 pm
	
		In March I stopped doing inventory because of COVID.  When I just started up again earlier this month I noticed it was not there.
	

	Brad 01:21:21 pm
	
		Alright, Tyla. I will contact the product team and see if this is something we can add back. Is there anything else I can help you with?
	

	Luke Foley 01:22:00 pm
	
		That's all, thanks so much, Brad!
	

	Brad 01:22:03 pm
	
		Have a great day, Tyla.

	Jana Lucas 10:58:38 am
	
		hi where can i go to mark items that i received from orders? some times we order 5 of something but only receive 3
	

	System 10:59:07 am
	
		You were transferred to Brad
	

	Brad 11:02:57 am
	
		Hi, Jana. Try going to Inventory > History > Click the arrow next to the ""Order"" received selection for the period you need. Then click the specific order you want to edit. Then find the line item you want to change.
	

	Jana Lucas 11:06:37 am
	
		so i just update the quantity in the order to 3 instead of 5?
	

	Brad 11:06:46 am
	
		Exactly, Jana.
	

	Jana Lucas 11:06:53 am
	
		ok one other question...
	
		when starting an inventory count and you click on a category (beer for example) why isnt the list alphabetized?
	

	Brad 11:12:02 am
	
		There are different ways to list the items in your inventory. Usually when doing inventory counts you want the inventory to be ordered sheet-to-shelf, meaning organized in the way you're counting the items off the shelf. I would suspect you have them ordered in this fashion. You can change it by clicking ""View Filter"" on the Inventory Page and choosing A-Z.
	
		If you choose ""Arrange as I count"" you can click the handles on the left and change the order manually. 
	

	Jana Lucas 11:17:17 am
	
		is it going to save that sort setting for next time when  i do inventory or do i have to change that setting every time?
	

	Brad 11:17:47 am
	
		It will save it that way to that inventory storage area until you change it.
	
		Jana, is there anything else I can help you with today?
	

	Jana Lucas 11:24:09 am
	
		no thats it, thank you
	

	Brad 11:24:18 am
	
		Have a great day, Jana!

		Hi, Frank. How can I help you?
	

	Frank Lopez 09:45:12 am
	
		Could you please process the sales reports for Later, Later and Lost & Found? Andrew said I could run my own Sales reports however when I run the report it does produce a ""Sales Input"" report for me to download. The  ""Sales Input"" and the ""Product Variance"" report are the ones that I need.
	

	Brad 09:45:37 am
	
		Frank let me take a look at this for you.
	
		Frank, I received the case for your sales report. I'll get right on that. As far as not seeing the Sales Input and Product Variance, you should be able to see both when you run it yourself, but I will take a look and see if I can replicate that issue.

		Hello, so I have batch recipes set up for a few items, is there any way to add batch recipes to other recipe items I couldn't simply type in the name for the dropdown.
	

	Brad 05:25:01 pm
	
		Hi, Sean. I'd be happy to help you with this. Let me pull up your account.
	
		Is this for University of Beer Sacramento?
	

	Sean Biggs 05:26:18 pm
	
		Yes
	

	Brad 05:27:35 pm
	
		Sean, I think you should look into prep items. That might be more useful for you.
	
		If you go into Inventory History and look in the top right, you will see a ""Record Prepared Item"" option
	
		Sean, if you would still like to add a recipe as an ingredient to a new recipe that shouldn't be an issue. They usually appear at the very bottom of the ""Add Ingredients"" list
	

	Sean Biggs 05:34:19 pm
	
		Perfect i see them now
	

	Brad 05:34:25 pm
	
		You'll need to adjust serving size to match the yield you want for each serving of the new recipe. Prep items can make this a little easier.
	
		Have a great night, Sean.

		BevSpot Support here! How can we help?
	

	Nick Hedrick 12:55:37 pm
	
		Good Afternoon Marguerite.
	
		We have a couple things today.  We need the two revenue centers that were added by BevSpot support to be deleted if we can.  We won't be needing those.
	

	Marguerite 12:56:30 pm
	
		Hi Nick!
	

	Nick Hedrick 12:57:04 pm
	
		Also, we have been getting nothing but error messages most of the day today while trying to count inventory.  My assistant is currently trying to do transfers and the system is erroring to the point he has given up and moved on to something else.
	
		It seems that we get an error pop up quite frequently.
	

	Marguerite 12:58:35 pm
	
		Hmmm... I'm sorry to hear that Nick. That sounds like that's pretty frustrating. Let's see if we can figure this out together. 
	
		And okay, we'll delete those accounts. 
	

	Nick Hedrick 01:00:08 pm
	
		Thank you.
	

	Marguerite 01:00:29 pm
	
		Now those transfers that are happening, does the items that he is transferring have homes within both accounts? 
	

	Nick Hedrick 01:00:52 pm
	
		Yes they do.
	

	Marguerite 01:01:18 pm
	
		Interesting. And are you both using Chrome for BevSpot? 
	

	Nick Hedrick 01:01:23 pm
	
		Yes.
	

	Marguerite 01:01:24 pm
	
		Or another type of browser? 
	

	Nick Hedrick 01:02:12 pm
	
		We use chrome pretty exclusively.
	

	Marguerite 01:03:53 pm
	
		Alright, the last thing I would like to see you guys do is delete your cache and cookies from your Chrome. Sometimes that can create errors within the system. 
	
		If that doesn't work, I'm going to let the engineering team know asap. 
	

	Nick Hedrick 01:08:00 pm
	
		We have tried that and no help
	
		with clearing the cache
	

	Marguerite 01:10:33 pm
	
		Alright. I'm sorry about this! Not sure what's going on but I'm going to chat with the engineering team to figure out what's going on. Thank you for your patience. I have your email and will keep you posted to get this resolved as soon as possible. 
	

	Nick Hedrick 01:10:41 pm

	Marguerite 02:23:11 pm
	
		Hey Ross! So just confirm, both the HH apple cider mule and the regular apple cider mule should be pulling from the same POS ID? 
	

	Ross Molineaux 02:26:52 pm
	
		They have two different pos id cause one is HH the other is regular but both should pull .5oz of apple jack. It shows HH but not regular apple mule under apple jack
	

	Marguerite 02:27:04 pm
	
		Gotchya 
	
		It looks like you have two applejacks in inventory. One being 750 ml and the other being 1L. The regular apple mule is being pulled from the 1L while the HH apple mule is being pulled from the 750ml.
	

	Ross Molineaux 02:34:39 pm

		BevSpot Support here! How can we help?
	

	Ivan Palacio 01:55:27 pm
	
		Good Afternoon
	

	Marguerite 01:55:36 pm
	
		Hi again, Ivan!
	

	Ivan Palacio 01:55:43 pm
	
		I hope all is well.
	
		So, I completed my first inventory. I was wondering if there was a way to correlate my POS sales and orders with my most recent inventory?
	

	Marguerite 02:00:15 pm
	
		Hi Ivan 
	
		First step is to enter in your recipes into BevSpot, that way you can map your BevSpot data to your Toast data. Right now, you are integrated,  but you have no data than is pulling from your sales. 
	
		*that 
	

	Ivan Palacio 02:08:14 pm
	
		Why would the sales not be pulling up?
	
		Could I fix that?
	

	Marguerite 02:10:18 pm
	
		Have you sold anything in the last day? 
	
		If you go into the profitability report and select the date from October 1st - today, run the report and then click into the pos data tab, you'll be able to see more of what you're probably looking for. 
	

	Ivan Palacio 02:19:08 pm
	
		Perfect, how do I get to to cross reference with my most current inventory?
	

	Marguerite 02:20:15 pm
	
		Do you see where it says ""unmapped"" to the right of the pos items? 
	
		You can map the pos item to your items within BevSpot. You can build out your recipes straight from this page. 
	

	Ivan Palacio 02:24:30 pm
	
		Yes, I see it. So, if I map these items it will cross reference with my inventory?
	

	Marguerite 02:25:10 pm
	
		Yes
	

	Ivan Palacio 02:25:25 pm
	
		Perfect, thank you for your help.
	

	Marguerite 02:25:33 pm
	
		But to see your variance, you'll need to run two inventory counts. 
	
		Yep, of course!

		BevSpot Support here! How can we help?
	

	Ben Gander 11:31:28 am
	
		Hey there, I'm trying to do a record transfer with our sister bar Trade from some cases of liquor we traded but i'm not seeing their location in the system
	

	Marguerite 11:32:57 am
	
		Hey Ben! 
	
		Let's see if we can figure this out together 
	

	Ben Gander 11:33:21 am
	
		Hey there, lovely
	

	Marguerite 11:35:08 am
	
		So what specifically is happening? 
	
		You're clicking on record transfer and then what's happening for ya? 
	

	Ben Gander 11:35:45 am
	
		when I go to choose transfer location nothings there
	
		I see my bar number nine
	
		but not Trade
	
		Our accounts used to be linked
	

	Marguerite 11:36:44 am
	
		Okay, is it allowing you to click on ""TO:""?
	

	Ben Gander 11:37:30 am
	
		I clicked receive before that, now it says To: Number Nine
	
		From: Choose transfer location - is what it says above that
	
		but there's nothing to choose from
	

	Marguerite 11:38:07 am
	
		Gotchya. 
	
		Is it allowing you to click on the arrow pointed down? Or are you not able to physically click it. 
	

	Ben Gander 11:38:42 am
	
		yes
	
		it flips Number Nine between from and to
	
		Can I give you what I took and you can record it on your end for Trade?
	

	Marguerite 11:41:04 am
	
		Sure!
	

	Ben Gander 11:41:58 am
	
		5 cases Stoli regular, 2 cases Absolut Mandarin, 2 cases Absolut Pear
	

	Marguerite 11:43:11 am
	
		Alright, Ben. We'll see what we can do to fix this for ya and keep you updated!
	

	Ben Gander 11:43:24 am
	
		thanks so much!
	

	Marguerite 11:45:26 am
	
		Hey Ben, are you still here? 
	

	Ben Gander 11:45:32 am
	
		yup
	

	Marguerite 11:45:37 am
	
		Just want to make sure we cover our bases. 
	
		Are the packaging of each of those items listed above the same? 
	

	Ben Gander 11:46:09 am
	
		yup!  12 in a case 1 liter bottles
	

	Marguerite 11:46:49 am
	
		Got it. Thank you!
	

	Ben Gander 11:47:31 am
	
		No thank you
	

	Marguerite 12:07:20 pm
	
		Hey Ben!
	
		If you're still here - have you ever changed the sizes of those products in the past? 
	

	Ben Gander 12:08:02 pm
	
		hmm i don't think so, are they in the system wrong?
	

	Marguerite 12:08:30 pm
	
		No, they're not in the system wrong. It's just that sometimes if you change the data on a product, you wont be able to transfer it. 
	
		So just wanted to see if you had changed that information recently 
	

	Ben Gander 12:09:04 pm
	
		hmm interested
	
		I don't believe so......
	
		 I have been putting them on special
	
		I did want to schedule a chat with someone about what i'm doing wrong with my inventory.  my product variance is so high every week and that can't be right
	

	Marguerite 12:14:13 pm
	
		Yeah, that would definitely be helpful to schedule some time with your account manager. Maybe they'd be able to see what is going wrong with your inventory transfers too. 
	
		https://app.hubspot.com/meetings/susan103
	
		This is Susan's calendar link for when you want to schedule some time!

		email would be preferable today, I am in and out of my office today.
	
		Thank you.
	

	Rob 10:31:42 am
	
		Absolutely!  Is nhedrick@cfholiday.com the best email for you?
	

	Nick Hedrick 10:31:59 am

		yes that is the correct email.

	Rob 01:50:05 pm
	
		You are able to edit unit sizes and packaging within the item level.  Additionally there is a text box in which you can add notes
	

	Rolf Hensche 01:51:29 pm
	
		I understand this but it only allows me to select from a drop down box and the dropdown only has four options namely bottle, keg, can and other.
	

	Rob 01:52:22 pm
	
		Could you provide a specific item example that you'd like to change.  I'll hop into your account to take a look with you
	

	Rolf Hensche 01:56:54 pm
	
		OK, hold on a sec
	

	Rob 01:57:03 pm
	
		Of course
	

	Rolf Hensche 01:57:36 pm
	
		Peter Vella Chablis White presently 4x5L other. It should really be a 5 lt box for example.
	

	Rob 01:57:56 pm
	
		Give me one minute and I'll take a look too
	
		Currently we do not have any options for packaging aside from the drop down list.  However it looks like you've added the Chablis correctly the reflect the size container
	
		An alternative would be to perhaps add the packaging as ""box"" within the item name
	

	Rolf Hensche 02:00:44 pm
	
		I know but we are looking to add food items to this too. Essentially, same idea with recipies and inventory. I would like to avoid to use two systems if I can.
	

	Rob 02:01:54 pm
	
		Aha, understood!  I'm going to provide a calendar link for your account manager to speak specifically to our food inventory management.  You'l be able to schedule some time there
	
		Otherwise if you are adding food items currently those would all have to be categorized as other and the weight, etc. could be changed similarly to how you've adjusted the Chablis
	

	Rolf Hensche 02:03:02 pm
	
		So you have a seperate food management piece?
	

	Rob 02:03:22 pm
	
		Yes we do!  Andrew, your account manager, can speak to that in more detail
	

	Rolf Hensche 02:03:32 pm
	
		ok, thank you

		Hi from BevSpot Support! Check out our help center at www.bevspot.com/help or chat us here if you have any questions as you move around the software.
	

	Nick Hedrick 03:17:51 pm
	
		Hi Ryan, we currently have an open ticket for our inventory/orders
	
		I received a response email and I am not sure if that is the solution to the problem.
	

	Laura 03:19:00 pm
	
		Hi Nick!
	

	Nick Hedrick 03:19:11 pm
	
		Hi Laura!
	

	Laura 03:19:13 pm
	
		Let me forward you over to support so they can check on your ticket
	
		sorry for all the bouncing around. 
	

	Nick Hedrick 03:19:34 pm
	
		No worries!

		Hi Nick! 
	

	Nick Hedrick 03:21:05 pm
	
		Hi Marguerite.  How are you today?
	

	Marguerite 03:21:33 pm
	
		I'm great. How are you, Nick! 
	

	Nick Hedrick 03:22:32 pm
	
		Doing well, thank you.  Were you able to see our issue from earlier?
	

	Marguerite 03:26:16 pm
	
		I think so! Did you get our email around 2:15 earlier today? 
	

	Nick Hedrick 03:27:18 pm
	
		Yes, but I don't think that would be the remedy.  When pulling the excel file for the inventory, other orders are in and we are able to see those counts under the received column.
	

	Marguerite 03:29:02 pm
	
		Interesting
	
		Are positive those orders fall within the most recent inventory period? 
	
		To the exact date and time? 
	

	Nick Hedrick 03:30:20 pm
	
		I believe so.  We should be doing October inventory so the 1st - 31st.
	

	Marguerite 03:30:57 pm
	
		Okay, diving into your account now to see if I can take a deeper look! 
	

	Nick Hedrick 03:31:36 pm
	
		Thank you.
	

	Marguerite 03:39:32 pm
	
		Nick, would you want to schedule a time to chat with Susan? She's your account manager and will be able to assist you with these types of things.

	Nick Hedrick 03:40:44 pm

		BevSpot Support here! How can we help?
	

	Nicholas Senneca 02:07:46 pm
	
		if i have an item not pulling its either because of the ID number thats not correct or the name is different
	

	Marguerite 02:08:08 pm
	
		Yep, or it's not mapped to the correct item 
	

	Nicholas Senneca 02:08:36 pm
	
		does the black part of the name have to be the same or blue
	

	Marguerite 02:09:04 pm
	
		The blue part is your item, the black part is the pos_od
	
		*pos_id
	
		doesnt necessarily have to be the same but they should both represent the same item 
	

	Nicholas Senneca 02:09:47 pm
	
		which one do you guys pull from
	

	Marguerite 02:09:58 pm
	
		What do you mean? 
	
		Want to give me an item as an example? 
	

	Nicholas Senneca 02:10:31 pm
	
		okay so my  ""take out margarita wastermelon jalapeno""
	
		it did not pull from report but it showed i sold the 11
	
		when making a new recipe would it be better to math the name from the report i send you guys
	

	Marguerite 02:13:58 pm
	
		And this is for Delray, correct? 
	

	Nicholas Senneca 02:14:20 pm
	
		ft lauderdale
	
		i just added them as a recipe  labeled correctly
	
		now i see there is another one names the same thing and its not pulling
	

	Marguerite 02:18:26 pm
	
		Yes, going back to your comment from before, it would be great if you matched the pos button name to the recipe within BevSpot. That way, we know what to map it to. 
	

	Nicholas Senneca 02:18:53 pm
	
		heard
	
		i just manually sales input in the item and it worked
	
		will it automattically pull now from that one or should we flag it for next time.
	

	Marguerite 02:20:25 pm
	
		Yes!
	

	Nicholas Senneca 02:20:45 pm
	
		do you have to flag it or me cause idk how to lol
	

	Marguerite 02:20:55 pm
	
		Well is it pulling correctly now? 
	
		If so, you don't have to flag. It will map future reports now too. 
	

	Nicholas Senneca 02:22:13 pm
	
		oh okay well perfect
	
		ill let you know if i need anything else thank you

		Hi Michael - in the top right corner of your account you should see three vertical dots

		Hi- the three dots do not appear on the page titled  Plans & Billing

	Michael Letterman 10:51:21 am
	
		ok I get the one for food but not the one for beverage if you can make sure I get the food one that would be great.

		You rated our customer service as good

		anyone home?
	

	Marguerite 04:06:06 pm
	
		Hi Harry!
	

	Harry Einhorn 04:06:15 pm
	
		Hello
	
		can you tell me how to print out an ingredient list with the items in categories to use for a count sheet when doing inventory
	

	Marguerite 04:07:41 pm
	
		For sure!
	
		If you go to the items page, you can click the three dots in the upper righthand corner and then click ""Export Items""
	
		Then an excel file should open for you with all your items and their categories ? 
	

	Harry Einhorn 04:13:24 pm
	
		when I try to print in excel it goes back to your page
	

	Marguerite 04:14:51 pm
	
		Hmm, does it download to the bottom of your screen to click into? 
	

	Harry Einhorn 04:14:59 pm
	
		yes
	

	Marguerite 04:15:28 pm
	
		And then what happens when you double click into it? 
	

	Harry Einhorn 04:17:40 pm
	
		it just shuts excel down for some reason
	

	Marguerite 04:18:01 pm
	
		Interesting. I'll download it for you and send it right over. That okay? 
	

	Harry Einhorn 04:18:18 pm
	
		thanks that would be great
	

	Marguerite 04:19:13 pm
	
		You got it. Sending now!

	Allyx O'Connor 11:37:52 am
	
		Hi! My manager finalized an interview yesterday but I can't seem to find it. Can you help point me in the right direction?
	
		I accidentally started a new one today but I don't think it should have erased yesterdays
	

	Marguerite 11:38:17 am
	
		Hi Allyx! Let's try and figure this out together. 
	

	Allyx O'Connor 11:38:58 am
	
		sounds good
	

	Marguerite 11:41:53 am
	
		Allyx, which account is this for? 
	

	Allyx O'Connor 11:42:38 am
	
		This is for Pickled Fish
	

	Marguerite 11:42:48 am
	
		Gotchya! 
	
		Alright,  so don't panic! There are two inventories for 11/22; one of them was finalized last week and the other last night. So it looks like the time stamp is throwing ya off which is an easy fix ?
	

	Allyx O'Connor 11:44:55 am
	
		oh got it!
	

	Marguerite 11:45:33 am
	
		So if you click into the most recent count, you'll see that Victoria finished it last night at around 7:11pm. 
	
		If you click in the upper three dots to the right, and then click ""edit count info""
	
		You can change the date to mirror what ever date/time you want it to be. 
	

	Allyx O'Connor 11:46:38 am
	
		oh great!
	
		Hmm so let's see, I think I did that right can you look on the history to see if it looks correct? Do I need to delete the accidental one for today to work off of that one?
	

	Marguerite 11:49:24 am
	
		Yep! It all looks correct now. 
	
		And yep! Feel free to go into the most recent count and delete it!
	

	Allyx O'Connor 11:49:59 am
	
		Ok perfect, thank you so much!
	

	Marguerite 11:50:09 am
	
		You're so welcome, Allyx! 
	

	Allyx O'Connor 11:50:24 am
	
		One more quick q, can you direct me to the right spot to connect LS?
	

	Marguerite 11:50:29 am
	
		100%
	
		On the left hand side of your screen, click into ""Settings""
	
		And then ""Integrations""
	
		The click where it says ""Create Integration"" beside LS
	

	Allyx O'Connor 11:52:45 am
	
		ok perfect, thanks a ton!
	

	Marguerite 11:52:54 am
	
		You got it!
	

	Allyx O'Connor 11:53:05 am
	
		That's all I need for the moment, have a great day!!

		Hey Nate
	

	Fort McMurray Club 02:41:41 pm
	
		Hi Rob. I am inputting my first invoice presently
	
		I sometimes receive beer in cases of 24, and sometimes as 28s
	
		What is the best way to input when I have different case sizes?
	

	Rob 02:43:06 pm
	
		Is it the same brand/beer or different beers?
	

	Fort McMurray Club 02:43:29 pm
	
		yes the same brand. I was editing the item to reflect the new case size and price, but sometimes this may fluctuate based on availability
	

	Rob 02:43:33 pm
	
		Gotcha
	
		is it always fluctuating between 24-28?
	
		for this particular beer
	

	Fort McMurray Club 02:45:30 pm
	
		theres a few different beers where this can happen. I always try to order the bigger cases as pricing is better, but if they are out of stock as my supplier seems to be fairly often, I will instead order the smaller case size. in this case, 24s vs 28s
	

	Rob 02:46:05 pm
	
		I know that situation all too well.  Want to call into the support line/I'll give you a ring to talk this through?
	

	Fort McMurray Club 02:46:33 pm
	
		Sure. What's the number?

	Michael Letterman 10:43:16 am
	
		ok
	

	Rob 10:45:59 am
	
		aha okay I've *kind of* got it.  This is not something that will be accessible in your account, although it is something that I can speak to billing about.  Are there particular invoices you are looking for and are you looking to have yourself included on a copy of that monthly invoice?
	

	Michael Letterman 10:51:21 am
	
		ok I get the one for food but not the one for beverage if you can make sure I get the food one that would be great.
	

	Rob 10:51:41 am
	
		I will make sure that you get both! 
michael.letterman@yotel.com correct?
	

	Michael Letterman 10:51:57 am

		BevSpot Support here! How can we help?
	

	Daniel Castaneda 10:30:47 am
	
		Morning.  Using this down-time to implement BevSpot.  We are a TOAST restaurant
	
		A manger is adding recepies.  All of our purchase items live in the database already..
	
		Does BevSpot poll how many of each item we sell?
	

	Marguerite 10:32:19 am
	
		Hi Daniel!
	
		Yes, it does. Once you integrate with Toast, you'll be able to see your sales compared to your usage to uncover any variances as well as being able to look at your overall profitability on each item. 
	

	Daniel Castaneda 10:34:14 am
	
		Where would I see that?  Just added 16 oz Pepsi.  How can I see how many of those I sold within BevSpot?
	

	Marguerite 10:35:52 am
	
		If you go to the ""Profitability"" tab under the sales section in your account, you can run a report to pull the sales data. From there, you will be able to match each item. Let's to some together! 
	
		We can also hop on a call if that would be easier for you. 
	

	Daniel Castaneda 10:37:31 am
	
		a call would be great.  I have several ""tiny"" questions....
	

	Marguerite 10:37:44 am
	
		You got it. What number should I call?
	

	Daniel Castaneda 10:38:19 am
	
		cell.  708-906-5139....that way I can use a headset.  Thanks!!

		I have a user, Sarah Negron, that was unable to log in on Sunday for inventory. She tried the reset password link to no avail. I deleted her profile and sent her a new invite. She never received anything, spam or otherwise. Is there a way to ""reset"" her as a user?
	
		I added another user with ease on Sunday, so this seemed odd.
	

	Marguerite 01:45:59 pm
	
		Hi Tom!
	
		Hmm that does seem weird! 
	
		What is her email? I can add her in on our side. 
	

	Tom Kriskey 01:46:47 pm
	
		sarahnegron13@gmail.com
	
		just a plain user, no privileges
	

	Marguerite 01:47:08 pm
	
		Also, did you want her added to Food, Bev or both? 
	

	Tom Kriskey 01:47:14 pm
	
		just bev
	

	Marguerite 01:47:25 pm
	
		Got it. Do you have her cell number on you by any chance? 
	

	Tom Kriskey 01:48:00 pm
	
		5088873259 (she's from Boston!)
	

	Marguerite 01:48:11 pm
	
		Oooh! Love that!!! 
	
		Alright, Sarah should be good to go with using the password, ""Bevspot123"".
	

	Tom Kriskey 01:50:19 pm
	
		with a capital ""B""?
	

	Marguerite 01:50:35 pm
	
		Yep! 
	

	Tom Kriskey 01:50:39 pm
	
		and will she be asked to make a new password?
	

	Marguerite 01:50:55 pm
	
		She won't be asked but she can change it once she's in. 
	

	Tom Kriskey 01:51:05 pm

		Hi, Looking at our variance from this most recent inventory. IM noticing we have 2 items for fortaleza repo and its showing a discrepancy. Is there any way we can get that cleaned u?
	
		I'm also seeing a similar issue for coors light.
	

	Rob 10:56:54 am
	
		Thanks for reaching out, can you let me know specifically what seems to be the discrepancy for those?
	

	Renato Bass 10:57:52 am
	
		there are 2 items labeled fortaleza repo. theyre showing a variance; one + and one -
	

	Rob 10:59:20 am
	
		okay let me take a look  - is there any reason there is a duplicate of those items?
	

	Renato Bass 11:00:11 am
	
		im not sure; someone may have added it by accident but there shouldnt be.
	

	Rob 11:01:12 am
	
		gotcha, makes sense but just wanted to check with you first
	
		any preference on which to remove?
	

	Renato Bass 11:02:11 am
	
		no, I think the one thats showing the negative variance is the original
	

	Rob 11:04:24 am
	
		understood
	
		I can go in and clean that up for you on both items that have duplicates!

		BevSpot Support here! How can we help?
	

	Allyx O'Connor 11:51:02 am
	
		Hello! I was wondering how to create recipes from my items on my POS. I can see how to create one from scratch, but I can't find any items from the POS
	

	Marguerite 11:52:30 am
	
		Hi Allyx! 
	
		Let me pop into your account, one sec!
	

	Allyx O'Connor 11:53:07 am
	
		thank you!
	

	Marguerite 12:00:20 pm
	
		Okay, so I just turned on the profitability report. That's probably the best way to use your POS data in conjunction with building out your recipes. 
	
		So, if you go to Sales > Profitability Report > POS Data... 
	
		You can build out your recipes at the same time as mapping them to the POS Id.
	
		Do you want to hop on a quick call? 
	

	Allyx O'Connor 12:04:05 pm
	
		Ok, thank you. It's a little noisy in the office so let me just try this really quick :)
	

	Marguerite 12:04:12 pm
	
		Yeah of course! 
	
		Before you go to the POS Data tab, run the report within the timeframe you wish to pull the items from. 
	

	Allyx O'Connor 12:04:44 pm
	
		So I need to wait for something to be ordered to show up here, is that correct?
	
		ah
	

	Marguerite 12:05:01 pm
	
		It can pull data from previous weeks. 
	
		https://cdn.livechat-static.com/api/file/lc/att/7006471/f0e73325c5fb4ce7ceac7fcf50163bf6/Screen%20Shot%202020-12-01%20at%203.05.12%20PM.png
	
		In the upper righthand corner, select the timeframe. Then, click ""Run Report"". 
	
		After, click over to the POS Data tab and you can map and build your recipes on that page. 
	

	Allyx O'Connor 12:06:11 pm
	
		Hmm, it says sales data not found for this date range?
	
		oh wait, i might have just had it wron
	
		g
	
		perfect!
	
		and then clicking unmapped will get me there?
	

	Marguerite 12:08:01 pm
	
		Correct! 
	

	Allyx O'Connor 12:08:19 pm
	
		Great. And a couple quick qs, what do most people do for things like simple syrup or juices?
	

	Marguerite 12:08:30 pm
	
		You can also sort by menu group is that makes it easier for you as well as omit any items such as modifiers or food items. 
	

	Allyx O'Connor 12:08:40 pm
	
		got it! Foudn that!
	

	Marguerite 12:09:34 pm
	
		For simple syrups and juices, it depends on what you want to track. I would definitely include them in your recipes but for profitability and sales reports, you can leave them out. 
	

	Allyx O'Connor 12:09:51 pm
	
		sounds good. so just create a recipe from scratch for those?
	

	Marguerite 12:10:55 pm
	
		Yeah, that would work!
	

	Allyx O'Connor 12:11:16 pm
	
		Ok, great. And then I saw something about bulk recipe uploading, is that only if I had the recipes in LS?
	

	Marguerite 12:11:48 pm
	
		Where do you see that? 
	

	Allyx O'Connor 12:12:06 pm
	
		I thought I saw it in the help center, one sec maybe I'm wrong lol
	
		ah, maybe it's bulk item updates, not recipes
	
		now that I'm looking at it againm
	

	Marguerite 12:13:08 pm
	
		Ahh yes! That would be great if we had a bulk recipe function but not yet at least! ? 
	

	Allyx O'Connor 12:13:59 pm
	
		no problem, I think that's all I needed!
	

	Marguerite 12:14:16 pm
	
		Okay, well you know where to find me if you run into any more trouble!

		Hi Marguerite, nice to talk to you again, hope you had a great thanksgiving
	
		I was chatting earlier today with Rob regarding an issue we found when I made the integration, he told me to reach out to LS and I did but it seems support channel in LS has no idea what I was talking about.
	
		I just wanted to come back to tell him that LS says it is a bevspot issue and they can't do anyhting on their side, can you please transmit that message to him?
	

	Marguerite 09:10:52 am

		I will let him know and hopefully we'll be able to get to the bottom of this for you as soon as possible.

		Hi, Flavio!
	

	Flavio Valenzuela 10:36:13 am
	
		hi there.
	
		Im looking to built a car, but I like to use weekly usage, Im currently doing monthly inventories, therefore the weekly usage will only compare to last inventory and may cause inventory shortages. How can I weekly order bases on usage?
	

	Marguerite 10:44:02 am
	
		That's a great question. I'm going to loop in your account manager, Andrew, and together, we can help figure out the best way to go about ordering for you. 
	

	Flavio Valenzuela 10:45:42 am
	
		ok
	
		?
	
		are you still there?
	

	Marguerite 11:03:07 am
	
		Hey, Flavio! Yes. Here is Andrew's calendar link to book some time either today or tomorrow (what ever works best for you!)

		hi
	

	Marguerite 01:22:19 pm
	
		Hey Nicholas!
	

	Nicholas Senneca 01:22:39 pm
	
		im wondering how my Sol beer is not pulling
	
		or copper point
	
		is it because of the name ?
	

	Marguerite 01:23:08 pm
	
		Hmmm... one sec. Let me see what's goin on!
	
		Fort Lauderdale, right?
	

	Nicholas Senneca 01:27:10 pm
	
		ya
	

	Marguerite 01:29:22 pm
	
		Alright so let's start with the 12oz bottle of Sol 
	
		That btl is mapped to the POS ID: 3948
	
		Is that the item to which it needs to be linked to? 
	

	Nicholas Senneca 01:31:58 pm
	
		yea

		Looks they were deleted on December 1st
	
		Might have something to do with it?
	

	Nicholas Senneca 01:39:42 pm
	
		hmmm
	
		what do ee do
	

	Marguerite 01:40:53 pm
	
		I can try restoring one of them and see if that fixed our problem. What is the correct sales price? $7 or $5?
	

	Nicholas Senneca 01:43:08 pm
	
		i think
	
		its $7
	

	Marguerite 01:49:44 pm
	
		Yeah, I'm not too sure exactly as to why the sales aren't pulling. I'm going to let Brian know. 
	

	Nicholas Senneca 01:58:17 pm
	
		ok
	
		its sol and copperpoint is not pulling

		Hi Sarah! When you say Items Category, what do you mean? 
	

	Sarah Molineux 12:14:39 pm
	
		 Under the items and recipes category I can run a report for all of the items. We are updating our inventory and I would like to print the list of everything we have ordered to reference what we have on hand.
	

	Marguerite 12:15:49 pm

		BevSpot Support here! How can we help?
	

	Ryan William Costanzo 02:13:16 pm
	
		I?m inputting my first invoices and double checking pricing on my orders
	
		i get promotion bottles of booze for free if I buy a full case
	
		how do I input the pricing and inventory to reflect this
	

	Rob 02:14:01 pm
	
		Hi Ryan, I'm happy to help with this
	

	Ryan William Costanzo 02:14:24 pm
	
		if I order 12 bottles I get 3 free
	

	Rob 02:14:30 pm
	
		When you are adding items there will be an area that allows you the make adjustments
	
		It should be a text box underneath adding your item for the invoice
	

	Ryan William Costanzo 02:14:49 pm
	
		ok
	

	Rob 02:15:16 pm
	
		This is where you will be able to put notes and adjust that price.  For example, you should put the total number of bottles as 15
	
		and then adjust -3x the cost of 1 bottle and add a note for your records
	

	Ryan William Costanzo 02:15:35 pm
	
		Ok
	
		ill keep messing with it
	

	Rob 02:15:56 pm
	
		Do you see the area that I'm mentioning?
	
		https://cdn.livechat-static.com/api/file/lc/att/7006471/1e182d6403602d5d90ab07dc55659cc3/Screen%20Shot%202020-12-08%20at%208.17.59%20PM.png
	
		Here is an example for your reference
	

	Ryan William Costanzo 02:34:04 pm
	
		Yeah I think so! Thank you
	

	Rob 02:34:21 pm
	
		Of course!  Let me know if you need any more help
	
		Just make sure that the amount you are adjusting is a negative number to reflect free bottles
	

	Ryan William Costanzo 02:34:57 pm
	
		Wait?
	
		I changed the price of the bottle, to reflect the pricing with the free
	
		Should I leave the price the same, but up the amount of bottles received, and take the adjustment down?
	

	Rob 02:36:14 pm
	
		I would leave the price per bottle at the regular cost
	

	Ryan William Costanzo 02:36:17 pm
	
		ok
	

	Rob 02:36:19 pm
	
		Put the total number of bottles in
	

	Ryan William Costanzo 02:36:23 pm
	
		i see
	

	Rob 02:36:28 pm
	
		and then in the adjustments put a negative number
	

	Ryan William Costanzo 02:36:36 pm
	
		Ok cool
	

	Rob 02:36:47 pm
	
		This way we are letting the system know that you arent getting a discount on the price, but rather some free bottles
	
		this will be helpful so that, in moving forward, if you don't get free bottles or the deal changes the price is consistent
	

	Ryan William Costanzo 02:39:28 pm
	
		Yes makes sense
	
		because I have to reach a certain amount to obtain the deal.
	
		Is there a way to have the app order in certain intervals to make sure it?s always hitting that deal amount?
	
		like is I have a six bottle limit I need to get 1 free. Any way to have it order in multiples of 6?
	
		if*
	

	Rob 02:41:35 pm
	
		There is a work around for that, yes.  First and foremost I would suggest going in to the item level and adding a note for every specific item that gets a deal
	
		That way we will have those marked and you will be able to see which items are ""deal eligible"", if you will
	

	Ryan William Costanzo 02:42:29 pm
	
		Ok cool
	

	Rob 02:42:41 pm
	
		Each of these items will then have a small red dogtag in the corner to let you know there is a note associated
	
		Is there an item in particular you can give me as an example, i'll make the change in your account on just that item so you can see what it looks like
	

	Ryan William Costanzo 02:43:33 pm
	
		Lunetta Proecco
	
		buy 12 get 4 free
	

	Rob 02:43:57 pm
	
		awesome, give me one minute ill show you with the lunetta
	

	Ryan William Costanzo 02:44:26 pm
	
		Ok
	

	Rob 02:44:31 pm
	
		https://cdn.livechat-static.com/api/file/lc/att/7006471/c86f1ea1832ec1b4b17f4a078dcbee18/Screen%20Shot%202020-12-08%20at%208.44.25%20PM.png

		you can add the notes at the bottom of the item-card when you click on any individual item
	

	Ryan William Costanzo 02:45:14 pm
	
		Ok so ? Your Notes? at the bottom
	

	Rob 02:45:17 pm
	
		exactly
	

	Ryan William Costanzo 02:45:33 pm
	
		thank you rob
	
		that is all
	

	Rob 02:45:37 pm
	
		and then when you see that item it will have the corner marked where you can hover your mouse over and see the notes
	

	Ryan William Costanzo 02:45:49 pm
	
		Thanks that will help
	
		i wi
	

	Rob 02:45:54 pm
	
		glad to help.  feel free to reach out on livechat or email support@bevspot if you need anything else!
	

	Ryan William Costanzo 02:46:08 pm

		you bet
	
		although the color seems to change to a yellow dogtag, but oh well

	Marguerite 11:05:51 am
	
		Hi Philip! Is this for Lost and Found? 
	

	Philip Pedregon 11:06:49 am
	
		Yes. Our other bar is Later Later and is experiencing the same
	

	Marguerite 11:07:57 am
	
		Got ya, I'm going to check the current status of those two accounts and let you know what I find. 
	

	Philip Pedregon 11:08:58 am
	
		Thnks
	

	Marguerite 11:10:17 am
	
		Okay, I have your email if you need to leave the chat before I have an answer. But I'll definitely get back to you in a bit! 
	

	Philip Pedregon 11:11:08 am
	
		No I?m here for now
	

	Marguerite 11:12:06 am
	
		What do you need turned on for the time being? 
	

	Philip Pedregon 11:13:38 am
	
		Well we process inventory on Tuesdays and weren?t able to bc of it. Is there a reason why it was deactivated
	

	Marguerite 11:14:37 am
	
		After talking with Andrew, your account manager, your accounts are currently on hold as requested as of a couple weeks ago. If you want to reactivate here is Andrew's calendar to book some time with him today to make it official. 
	
		https://app.hubspot.com/meetings/adodd
	
		For the time being, you should be able to access what you need to take your inventory for both accounts. 
	

	Philip Pedregon 11:16:18 am
	
		But We have been processing everything as normal for at least 2 weeks. Yesterday was the first day with issues
	

	Marguerite 11:17:22 am
	
		Hmm interesting! 
	
		I'm sure it will all be cleared up with Andrew. But as said, your inventory should be back open. Let me know if you can see that on your end!

		Hi from BevSpot Support! Check out our help center at www.bevspot.com/help or chat us here if you have any questions as you move around the software.
	

	Sarah Thomas 02:55:33 pm
	
		We don't have wireless in our cooler or freezer. Is the best way to handle this to print an inventory list for those areas? What's the easiest way to print an inventory worksheet for certain areas. Last time I tried to count in the cooler with the application it worked for a little bit then the screen refreshed and I lost all my counts.
	

	Marguerite 02:55:43 pm
	
		Hi Sarah! 
	
		If you have a hard time staying connected to WiFi while taking an inventory, our Offline Mode will make sure you don?t drop any of the data that you work hard to get into BevSpot.
	

	Sarah Thomas 02:56:34 pm
	
		How do you go into offline mode?
	

	Marguerite 02:56:50 pm
	
		So, when you guys walk into the cooler or the freezer, keep counting as usual. Before finishing your count, or leaving for another section of BevSpot (ordering, sales, etc.), make sure your account has re-synced with your WiFi.

		BevSpot Support here! How can we help?
	

	Charles Trefes 12:26:44 pm
	
		I have a question that I feel like should be easy but for some reason I can't seem to find....Where do I find the total number of cases that I have ordered for say one brand of rum?
	

	Marguerite 12:27:40 pm
	
		Hi Charles! 
	

	Charles Trefes 12:27:46 pm
	
		Hi
	

	Marguerite 12:28:06 pm
	
		Let's see if I can point you to the right direction. 
	

	Charles Trefes 12:28:40 pm
	
		I hope so
	
		Looking to see from say May till now what I have ordered of something. I really feel like I shouldn't have to ask this.
	

	Marguerite 12:29:58 pm
	
		Charles, which account are you associated with?
	

	Charles Trefes 12:30:06 pm
	
		Windjammer
	

	Marguerite 12:32:51 pm
	
		If you go to the order history page, you can download a report within a specified timeframe. 
	
		You can click ""Download Order Records"" and each item and order will be downloaded into an excel spreadsheet. 
	

	Charles Trefes 12:37:03 pm
	
		I guess to do that I have to upgrade something. $179 a month doesn't get reports?
	
		What plan do I need to get this information?
	

	Marguerite 12:38:40 pm
	
		Your account manager, Andrew, will be able to talk to you about that. 
	
		Here is his calendar link to schedule some time either today or tomorrow!
	
		https://app.hubspot.com/meetings/adodd
	
		Charles, you are also able to get order reports. Just not as far back as it looks like you're trying to go. 
	
		For example, try July 1st - today.
	

	Charles Trefes 12:43:14 pm
	
		That still doesn't get me a case number from a brand just amounts from the vendor.
	
		I want to see that I ordered X number of Cruzan Rum

		If you scroll over to the other tabs within the report, you might be able to see more of the type of information you're looking for. 
	

	Charles Trefes 12:46:34 pm
	
		Ok I see that
	

	Marguerite 12:46:49 pm
	
		Not sure how familiar you are with Excel, however, if I were you, I'd sort by ABC order within column G. That way you would see all of your items together. 
	

	Charles Trefes 12:47:20 pm
	
		Just about enough to make that happen
	

	Marguerite 12:47:26 pm
	
		Awesome!
	

	Charles Trefes 12:49:57 pm
	
		It just seems that there should in the system be a way to look up your item as you put it in and it tell you what you have ordered to date or in a date range. Without having to adjust a excel report to do so. Maybe thats just me. Anyway thanks
	

	Marguerite 12:51:50 pm
	
		Charles, there is a way to do that but it currently isn't possible to do that within the plan you're currently in. I can provide you with an example if you want! But these conversations always are much better with your account manager. They're a lot better at showing/explaining things than I am and are better equipped to talk pricing to make sure it works for you. 
	

	Charles Trefes 12:54:23 pm
	
		To bad that your company can't see that it would be better to have one stop shopping and have me talk to you now and get upgraded now when I might just say screw it later. Anyway thanks for the help that you could provide.

		BevSpot Support here! How can we help?
	

	Daniel Castaneda 12:04:46 pm
	
		Hey Rob.  Are ya' there?
	

	Rob 12:04:58 pm
	
		In fact yes, yes I am! How can I help you?
	

	Daniel Castaneda 12:05:20 pm
	
		Ok. New to Bev Spot but getting the hang of it now.
	
		Question, can I assign a purchasing manager to the Bev SPOT Liquor portion with NO access to the Food?
	
		..I want to keep them separated.
	

	Rob 12:06:28 pm
	
		If you have two different accounts set up with BevSpot (one for food/one for beverage) then absolutely you can
	

	Daniel Castaneda 12:06:57 pm
	
		Can you verify that I do?  I know that I have to toggle between both of them..
	

	Rob 12:07:24 pm
	
		Happy to verify that!  Which account in particular are you working with?
	

	Daniel Castaneda 12:07:40 pm
	
		one of them has the fork and spoon icon and the other one has a bottle icon...
	

	Rob 12:08:05 pm
	
		Taking a look as we speak, give me just a minute
	
		https://cdn.livechat-static.com/api/file/lc/att/7006471/d614fde14b286d6cac2271a933a12397/Screen%20Shot%202020-12-10%20at%208.08.49%20PM.png
	
		Currently it looks like you (and myself) are the users for the account
	

	Daniel Castaneda 12:09:41 pm
	
		yeah.  I want to assign another manager JUST to liquor....
	

	Rob 12:10:01 pm
	
		understood
	

	Daniel Castaneda 12:10:05 pm
	
		I don't want him to have access to FOOD.
	

	Rob 12:11:09 pm
	
		gotcha.  It looks like this account is only for beverage, and in that case you would be able to assign them to access for just liquor
	

	Daniel Castaneda 12:13:06 pm
	
		I guess, my question is.....shouldn't there be a box where I can pick FOOD or LIQ in the USERS screen?
	

	Rob 12:13:55 pm
	
		the food account and the beverage account will be separated, so your users that are assigned to each respective account will only have access to that account
	

	Daniel Castaneda 12:14:51 pm
	
		Ah!!! so go to the LIQ site and assign the user there?
	

	Rob 12:15:05 pm
	
		exactly!  and then they will be able to access the LIQ page (only)
	

	Daniel Castaneda 12:15:46 pm
	
		NICE!!! thanks (insert ""mind blown"" emoji here. :)
	

	Rob 12:16:11 pm
	
		? happy to help!!  If you have any other questions or need any other help let me know
	

	Daniel Castaneda 12:16:28 pm
	
		Nope.  Signing off.  Be safe.
	

	Rob 12:16:35 pm

		Good Afternoon Rob
	

	Rob 12:27:43 pm
	
		Hi Ryan
	

	Ryan William Costanzo 12:27:57 pm
	
		Trying to put my pricing in for how much I sell a bottle of wine.
	
		So I can look at the mark up percentage on my wine list
	
		I do not know where to put how much I sell an item for?
	

	Rob 12:28:48 pm
	
		You'll do this in your recipes section
	

	Ryan William Costanzo 12:29:05 pm
	
		ok So i have to make Recipes for each bottle of wine?
	

	Rob 12:29:25 pm
	
		yes, you can set the bottle as 1 serving, for example, and have it be the full bottle
	

	Ryan William Costanzo 12:29:38 pm
	
		ok.
	

	Rob 12:29:39 pm
	
		then when you add this as a recipe it will show you the cost percentage of that item
	

	Ryan William Costanzo 12:29:40 pm
	
		thanks
	

	Rob 12:29:43 pm
	
		of course

		BevSpot Support here! How can we help?
	

	kevin girkins 04:42:01 pm
	
		Hi there, Im trying to map items from Toast into Bevspot so we can track sales. My problem is that Im not seeing certain selections in Bevspot that I know are in Toast and can see the there
	
		How do I sync the two platforms so that all the options are seeable and can be mapped
	

	Marguerite 04:43:01 pm
	
		Hi Kevin! 
	
		Let me pop into your account... one sec!
	

	kevin girkins 04:44:40 pm
	
		Thank you very much. For instance I am just starting my mapping process and for items like the Fat Tire amber beer I cannot find in Bevspot. Then with Prairie brewing I have 4 different by the can options, but in Bevspot Im only seeing Prairie sour, rather than any of the 4 options
	

	Marguerite 04:45:06 pm
	
		Do you have all those items in your inventory within BevSpot? 
	

	kevin girkins 04:45:18 pm
	
		Is that the issue?!
	
		I'm gonna feel stupid if its that simple and I just overlooked thsi
	
		haha
	

	Marguerite 04:46:12 pm
	
		Hahah well you shouldnt feel stupid if that's the case. It always gets a little confusing when working with two different softwares. Let me verify for you!
	

	kevin girkins 04:46:26 pm
	
		Im sure thats it

		BevSpot Support here! How can we help?
	

	Philip Pedregon 10:02:41 am
	
		Hi. It looks like I have 2 different michelob ultras in my inventory that are throwing stats off. How can I correct this as one is showing a positive amount with no deliveries and the other the opposite
	

	Marguerite 10:03:42 am
	
		Hi Philip! You can archive one of the duplicates and just continue on with one of them for inventory and ordering purposes. 
	
		By archiving, you won't lose any historical data on that item, however it won't be there anymore for you to count or order. 
	

	Philip Pedregon 10:06:00 am
	
		Will the current data as far as orders etc transfer over?
	

	Marguerite 10:06:22 am
	
		No, there is no way to merge data from two items into one. 
	
		However, you'll still be able to see the historical data on that one item you choose to archive. 
	
		So either you need to pick the one you've been counting on or the one you've been ordering on. 
	

	Philip Pedregon 10:08:48 am
	
		Not too sure how this happened but can you help me apply the order that?s shown to the item that is showing a positive 43 units and delete the other one that?s showing under excluded
	

	Marguerite 10:09:05 am
	
		Let me take a look!
	

	System 10:09:24 am
	
		You were transferred to Rob
	

	Rob 10:12:33 am
	
		Hi Philip, I'm hopping into your account right now to  take a look at the michelob discrepancy
	

	Philip Pedregon 10:12:44 am
	
		Thank you
	
		Any luck
	

	Rob 10:21:29 am
	
		Can you clarify which account, when I look in Lost/Found I see a few Michs but they are differently priced and labeled, in Born/Raised I see a handful of Mich but again, same thing where they are denoted as different items and not duplicates
	
		working my way through Later/Later now
	

	Philip Pedregon 10:22:42 am
	
		This is specifically for Lost & Found
	
		only
	

	Rob 10:22:51 am
	
		gotcha
	

	Philip Pedregon 10:23:38 am
	
		If you go to product variance there is one mich ultra  with a high positive. That one needs to be the only one and orders applied to it
	

	Rob 10:24:19 am
	
		okay - I was looking on the item level and seeing Mich Ultra and Mich Ultra Gold. I'll go into variance now
	

	Philip Pedregon 10:25:02 am
	
		Not GOLD.... Michelob Ultra
	

	Rob 10:25:17 am
	
		I understand
	

	Philip Pedregon 10:32:10 am
	
		Any luck
	

	Rob 10:34:03 am
	
		It looks like orders for Mich Ultra are not being recorded which is contributing to the variance.  We're going through some order history now to understand why this is happening
	

	Philip Pedregon 10:34:44 am
	
		im pressed for time and we?re over 30 minutes now. Was hoping this was an easy fix
	
		you just restated basically what I?ve already pointed out in the beginning
	
		can?t you, or I, just delete one and apply the order to the other???
	

	Rob 10:36:57 am
	
		The problem is that I am not seeing a duplicate of the mich ultra
	
		I'm only seeing one, which is why we can't just delete it
	
		So there is either an error in the count, or orders were not input for this item.  Im sorry that it is taking longer than expected but we are also trying to figure out why this is happening
	

	Philip Pedregon 10:40:08 am
	
		There is a Michelob Ultra with L&F being the vendor. There is also a Michelob Michelob Ultra (that?s exactly how it shows) with Pecs as vendor. Do you see that?
	

	Rob 10:40:20 am
	
		No I do not, I only see these two
	
		https://cdn.livechat-static.com/api/file/lc/att/7006471/93529ea5c5804aa5e6bae2fb1279c6bc/Screen%20Shot%202020-12-23%20at%206.40.25%20PM.png
	
		Did you delete or archive the item from Pecs?
	

	Philip Pedregon 10:43:39 am
	
		No. I normally get that product through L&F however last week I purchased through specs and edited when inputting for orders to reflect that. Which I?ve done several times with no issues
	

	Rob 10:44:07 am
	
		Now seeing the MIch Mich Ultra - it was archived and not showing up early.  We are changing the order to reflect properly now to solve the variance issue with the mich that is on the report
	

	Philip Pedregon 10:44:36 am
	
		Awesome
	

	Rob 10:48:07 am
	
		Should be remedied now
	

	Philip Pedregon 10:48:28 am
	
		Just noticed. Thank you ppreciate you all
	

	Rob 10:48:32 am

		sorry we were a little slow to get to the bottom of this, but glad it's all set!
	

	Philip Pedregon 10:49:01 am
	
		all good have a good one
	

	Rob 10:49:05 am
	
		you too

	Ryan William Costanzo 05:40:57 pm
	
		Hello.
	

	Marguerite 05:41:05 pm
	
		Hi Ryan!
	

	Ryan William Costanzo 05:41:38 pm
	
		Just a quick question... How do I add a new item I received to my inventory, that I did not order through BEVSPOT
	
		I do not want to send an order to my REP, but need to add the bottles of wine I received today.
	

	Marguerite 05:46:49 pm
	
		Gotya! 
	
		Let me think on that one... 
	

	Ryan William Costanzo 05:47:39 pm
	
		Is there a way to make a ""Fake order""?
	

	Marguerite 05:47:42 pm
	
		Yes!
	
		If you build your order on your cart builder, at the end, just press ""record order"" instead of ""place order"".
	

	Ryan William Costanzo 05:48:30 pm
	
		ok thank you
	

	Marguerite 05:48:36 pm
	
		You're welcome!

	Marguerite Tue, 12/22/20 09:52:54 am America/Los_Angeles
	
		BevSpot Support here! How can we help?
	

	Alden Hozouri 09:53:43 am
	
		Hello, I was told we'd be able to use BevSpot for my cafe. We are not selling alcohol - all my products are coffee and tea based. However when I try to add items, I can only add alcoholic item
	

	Marguerite 09:55:12 am
	
		Hi Alden - no worries here! You can add in your own items. 
	
		I you can add items directly through BevSpot or you can bulk add them from an excel spreadsheet. What do you think would work best for you for the time being? 
	

	Alden Hozouri 09:56:11 am
	
		probably directly through BevSpot
	

	Marguerite 09:58:15 am
	
		Got ya.
	
		So - let's go to your items page 
	

	Alden Hozouri 09:58:53 am
	
		Cool. My options are Quick Add, Import from Invoice, or Bulk Add
	

	Marguerite 09:59:39 am
	
		Is there an option that says, ""Create New""?
	

	Alden Hozouri 09:59:50 am
	
		Not as far as I can see
	

	Marguerite 10:01:05 am
	
		Okay, for right now, let's just add in one item from the Quick Add option. 
	
		Let me know when you add one. Doesnt matter which one!
	

	Alden Hozouri 10:01:38 am
	
		How do I add something other than alcohol?
	
		My only options are a bunch of beers, wines, spirits and mixers
	
		And I cannot move past this page without selecting from the list
	

	Marguerite 10:03:23 am
	
		For the time being, just add an item that's alcohol. 
	
		I know you don't sell any alcohol but it's a quick way to get you to the page that will help you add in your own items one by one. 
	
		We can delete after 
	

	Alden Hozouri 10:06:08 am
	
		Ok
	
		How can I create my own category? The add button in there is greyed out
	

	Marguerite 10:09:44 am
	
		Start typing within that box and then it won't be greyed out anymore. 
	

	Alden Hozouri 10:11:15 am
	
		Brilliant
	

	Marguerite 10:11:31 am
	
		I am, yes. 
	

	Alden Hozouri 10:11:47 am
	
		Haha I'll give that to you
	
		Alright I think I can putz around from here and figure it out. Thank you again for your help
	

	Marguerite 10:12:55 am
	
		You sure? Did you figure out how to add your items? 
	

	Alden Hozouri 10:13:39 am
	
		I did! Got the first one in now, just cleaning up the details and costs, etc
	

	Marguerite 10:14:26 am
	
		Okay. Amazing - you, too, are brilliant! Let me know if you have any questions. Good luck! 
	

	Alden Hozouri 10:15:14 am
	
		Thanks Marguerite. Must be feeding off your brilliance
	
		Have a great week
	

	Marguerite 10:15:38 am
	
		You too!!!

		BevSpot Support here! How can we help?
	

	Devin Link 04:02:13 pm
	
		Hello again, so I am going through mapping our bar items in the profitability report under the sales tab, and noticed that there are a lot of items that are not appearing on the list
	
		for instance, we probably have 20 items in the 'Scotch' category, but it is only showing 7 items, why is this, and how can I get them to populate on this list? I have tried adjusting date ranges, but doesnt seem to affect the items listed, only the sales
	

	Marguerite 04:04:46 pm
	
		Hi Devin! 
	
		Let me think on that... 
	

	Devin Link 04:08:22 pm
	
		okay
	

	Marguerite 04:12:56 pm
	
		Hmmm... I'm not seeing that either. All I am able to see are the 7 scotches like you said above. 
	
		This data should be flowing in directly from your POS 
	

	Devin Link 04:13:37 pm
	
		right, but if you look at our item list under the items and recipes and sort by subcategory, you'll be able to see there are several more that should be listed
	
		but then in the recipes tab, it is just showing the same 7 from the profitability report
	

	Marguerite 04:14:34 pm
	
		Gotchya. The two pages are completely different though. If you want to map all of your scotches, then all of them need to have POS IDs as well. 
	

	Devin Link 04:14:49 pm
	
		they are all already in our POS
	

	Marguerite 04:15:06 pm
	
		Okay so which scotches do you need to still map? Can you give me one example? 
	

	Devin Link 04:15:17 pm
	
		johnnie walker red
	
		jw red
	

	Marguerite 04:16:22 pm
	
		Alright so I see it in your items, but not on the profitability page. 
	

	Devin Link 04:16:45 pm
	
		yes, same.
	

	Marguerite 04:16:46 pm
	
		What is JW Red's POS id?
	

	Devin Link 04:17:41 pm
	
		how do I view that if it's not listed on the profitability report?
	

	Marguerite 04:18:22 pm
	
		You'd need to look on your pos for its id. 
	

	Devin Link 04:20:08 pm
	
		I am guessing that all of these items missing  need a POS ID assigned huh?
	

	Marguerite 04:21:01 pm
	
		Probably! 
	

	Devin Link 04:21:24 pm
	
		is it the GUID?
	

	Marguerite 04:21:56 pm
	
		But basically, once you have ids built out in your pos, those ids will flow right into BevSpot and you'll be able to map the items in your inventory to those ids. 
	

	Devin Link 04:22:44 pm
	
		but i'll have to go through each individual item and look up its ID and assign it in bevspot?
	
		its at least a couple hundred items...
	

	Marguerite 04:23:40 pm
	
		Nope! 
	

	Devin Link 04:24:19 pm
	
		do I need the ID from the scotch category or the ID from jw red? im not following I dont think...
	

	Marguerite 04:24:50 pm
	
		When building out your POS Ids in your POS, how do you do that? 
	

	Devin Link 04:25:18 pm
	
		im not sure what you mean when you say building out
	
		I was not involved in the initial set up of our POS or items
	
		or this would be a non issue haha
	

	Marguerite 04:26:23 pm
	
		Devin, I don't want to lead you down the wrong path since I am no expert in POS machines. What do you say that we hop on a call tomorrow, maybe loop in Andrew again? Hopefully after that you'll have a much better understanding and able to see those scotches in no time. 
	
		Would that work for you? 
	

	Devin Link 04:26:55 pm
	
		I won't be able to get on a call until after the holidays
	
		is the weekend available to meet?
	

	Marguerite 04:27:38 pm
	
		That's okay! I'll work with Andrew to send you a comprehensive guide tomorrow via email and then we'll be able to go from there. 
	

	Devin Link 04:28:20 pm
	
		okay sounds good, and if Im still getting nowhere I will set up another call for monday
	

	Marguerite 04:28:28 pm
	
		Sounds like a plan! 
	

	Devin Link 04:29:13 pm
	
		okay thank you again!
	
		have a good evening

	Devin Link 12:49:55 pm
	
		okay
	

	Marguerite 12:50:01 pm
	
		Try refreshing your page and see if that works ? 
	

	Devin Link 12:50:38 pm
	
		I still have the same set of reports as I did previously
	

	Marguerite 12:51:00 pm
	
		Hmmm... 
	
		If you look under ""sales"", do you see an option for ""profitability""? 
	

	Devin Link 12:51:43 pm
	
		I do not have a 'sales' tab in my dashboard
	
		is it something our main account user has to grant permissions to within bevspot?
	

	Marguerite 12:52:40 pm
	
		Perhaps - Let me just thin a little bit more. 
	
		Which account is this? Just to make sure. 
	

	Devin Link 12:53:02 pm
	
		Cunninghams on the Lake
	
		we have several users, but the owner, Mike Anderson was set up as the main and us managers have access as well
	

	Marguerite 12:54:41 pm
	
		Alright - looks like you're set up without admin access. I think that's what the problem is.
	

	Devin Link 12:55:01 pm
	
		okay, will he have to go in and adjust that, or can you do it remotely?
	

	Marguerite 12:55:09 pm
	
		I can do it on my end! 
	

	Devin Link 12:55:14 pm
	
		okay perfect
	

	Marguerite 12:55:29 pm
	
		Alright, now try ?
	

	Devin Link 12:55:51 pm
	
		ahh now I have a sales tab
	
		and I see the profitability report, thank you
	

	Marguerite 12:56:14 pm
	
		Perfect! Third time's a charm. 
	

	Devin Link 12:56:27 pm
	
		thanks for your help! have a good one!
	

	Marguerite 12:56:31 pm
	
		You're welcome, Devin!

		BevSpot Support here! How can we help?
	

	Daniel Castaneda 10:37:50 am
	
		M, are ya' there? I have a quick question......
	

	Marguerite 10:40:21 am
	
		Hi Daniel!
	
		I am ?
	

	Daniel Castaneda 10:44:34 am
	
		Great.  When I register items of various weight in cart builder ....like cases of steak I ADD total poundage and multiply that by the price/pound.
	
		...my question is, is there a way where I can register EACH individual case without having to create a NEW item? Please note that each case varies in weight.
	
		Some times we receive up to (8) cases of OUTERSKIRT steak per drop.....
	

	Marguerite 10:49:54 am
	
		So with that, every time that item comes in, you'll have to edit that each time. If the weight changes each time, then in BevSpot, your unit size will change each time. 
	

	Daniel Castaneda 10:52:06 am
	
		Yeah.  So what I've been doing is adding the total pounds and changing the item once.  I wanted to see if there is a different way of doing this WITHOUT changing the item 8 times......
	
		i.e. look at my RESTAURANT DEPOT receipt with attachment and corresponding item....
	
		Would LOVE to have option of registering individual items (...should 1 case go missing...this way I know...which case is missing)
	
		I'll just register individual weights in Notes section, then.
	

	Marguerite 11:03:54 am
	
		There is no different way to do this so for right now, this seems like it is the best option. In the next few months, we should have an update out that will allow for this. 
	

	Daniel Castaneda 11:05:04 am
	
		Ok.  Thanks.  I'm sure that other restaurants have been asking for this, right?  In any case....Happy Holidays, be safe. .....D.
	

	Marguerite 11:05:41 am
	
		Happy Holidays, D!!!

		BevSpot Support here! How can we help?
	

	Luis Santiago 03:39:17 pm
	
		Hi Marie, Andrew Dodd was helping me earlier to switch to the new bevspot program but it seems that it did not got through for some strange reason
	
		Not sure if its something you could help me with
	

	Marguerite 03:46:31 pm
	
		Hi Luis - Thanks for chatting in. I think we were going to keep you on the sales reporting you're currently used to and then next week, talk about making the transition. 
	

	Luis Santiago 03:47:39 pm
	
		Oh, my boss wants it today, I kind of have no choice to be honest
	

	Marguerite 03:50:01 pm
	
		I can help get your sales report over to you today. Can you please send me over a pmix? support@bevspot.com ?
	

	Luis Santiago 03:50:51 pm
	
		Definitely but what about the new bevspot format
	

	Marguerite 03:52:25 pm
	
		We're still checking to make sure we can seamlessly transition you over but want to make sure you guys get your report today. 
	

	Luis Santiago 03:53:13 pm
	
		ok, I have to do a few things that Andrew and I spoke about first then I can send it over. When do you close?
	

	Marguerite 03:55:11 pm
	
		I actually just processed your report! 
	

	Luis Santiago 03:56:00 pm
	
		woah woah woah.
	
		I haven't submitted the pmix
	
		thats wrong..
	

	Marguerite 03:57:03 pm
	
		Looks like we received the pmix 30 minutes ago 
	

	Luis Santiago 03:57:38 pm
	
		Yes, that was for last week, I was working on something with Brian but he never processed it.. that is what Andrew and I were working on today.
	

	Marguerite 03:58:53 pm
	
		Oh I'm sorry - I'll just go ahead and delete that report then. 
	
		If you can send the pmix over sometime tonight that would be great. 
	

	Luis Santiago 03:59:36 pm
	
		Yes but please switch the format
	
		I need it switched
	

	Marguerite 04:00:38 pm
	
		Once I receive the PMIX, I'll make sure that the format is switched for you to view. 
	

	Luis Santiago 04:02:55 pm
	
		I just dont understand, Andrew switched it for me earlier. What is the difference between now and later? some clarification would be nice
	

	Marguerite 04:11:42 pm
	
		I think the best way to solve this would be to get on the phone with Andrew and myself. Would you be available in the next few minutes? 
	

	Luis Santiago 04:12:10 pm
	
		Yes
	

	Marguerite 04:13:31 pm
	
		Great - going to give you a call now.

		HI. i am having an issue with my category report for the month
	

	Marguerite 12:45:30 pm
	
		Hi - Can you tell me more about that? 
	

	Michaela Achey 12:46:17 pm
	
		if you are able to see my account...in my sales history where our reports are saved...my recent one I just finished today. It does not read ""other"" categry
	
		i have sales in, orders in and all numbers from last months inventory for other look good
	
		but when report is generated..""other"" category is 0%
	

	Marguerite 12:48:34 pm
	
		Interesting - let me take a look 
	

	Michaela Achey 12:49:40 pm
	
		thank you
	

	Marguerite 12:57:37 pm
	
		Are you tracking your usage of items categorized under ""other""? 
	

	Michaela Achey 12:58:43 pm
	
		 well in november 22 all other sales, counts = usage was recorded
	
		yesterday all usage was recorded
	
		i have never had this issue befoe
	
		what else am i supposed to do other than count all other, make sure i input all orders for other and i input sales for other
	

	Marguerite 01:00:28 pm
	
		Which items are categorized under ""other"" 
	
		Let's see if I can track where the issue is stemming from
	
		Let's just start with one example 
	

	Michaela Achey 01:00:51 pm
	
		other is all out non alco
	

	Marguerite 01:00:55 pm
	
		Got ya
	

	Michaela Achey 01:00:56 pm
	
		fruit etc
	
		juices
	
		it started last month, november 22nd i was able to generate report with no missing info
	
		now i look at that report i sent the 22nd normally ..and it is missing other as well...so must have happened after nOvember 23rd
	
		maybe settings got changed or something
	
		anything :}?
	

	Marguerite 01:10:11 pm
	
		Looking into your count summary right now - that will give us a better understanding of the usage that BevSpot is pulling. 
	
		I'm going to check internally with my team to see if anything has been changed recently in your account. I'm not too sure it has been but I'll email you once I have more of an answer for you!
	

	Michaela Achey 01:17:04 pm
	
		 thank you so much
	

	Marguerite 01:18:30 pm
	
		Of course!

	GAry Hipko 11:32:12 am
	
		chrome
	
		looks like it allows for a trial inventory and order
	

	Brad 11:33:23 am
	
		Gary, it may be that I have to switch on some features for you. I will look into that, but while I do I'd like you to follow these instructions to clear your web browser cache.
https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/32050
	

	GAry Hipko 11:37:44 am
	
		done
	

	Brad 11:39:59 am
	
		Gary, we're having difficulties with our internal communication tools at the moment, so I wasn't able to talk to your account manager to verify all the features you should have access to. Temporarily, you may have access to more features than were intended. I am just letting you know until I can contact Susan to have her properly adjust things for me. You should have access to anything you're use to in the meantime. Please reach out again if anything seems different. We do have customers transitioning to updated parts of the platform and the user experience may be different for you if you're accustomed to them.

		Hi Matthew, I was entering final items for my December Inventory which I hadn't finished the count yet and archived some items that were 'doubles,"" or no longer available. I noticed before I archived those items that my Inventory number was over 36K. After I archived those items my number went down to 34k+. Any way I can retrieve those numbers that were lost?
	

	Matthew 05:00:38 pm
	
		Hello Genel, thank you for reaching out about your inventory count. I am going to transfer the chat to one my colleagues on our Support side. One moment, have a nice evening!

		Hi Genel! Let me see if we can figure this out together. 
	

	Genel Thompson 05:02:29 pm
	
		Hi Marguerite, Ok, great thank you
	

	Marguerite 05:05:48 pm
	
		Genel - do you want to unarchive those items you archived?
	

	Genel Thompson 05:06:40 pm
	
		I did that thinking my number would go back up to the original amount but it didn't
	

	Marguerite 05:06:51 pm
	
		Are those items back to a 0 count? 
	

	Genel Thompson 05:07:02 pm
	
		yes
	

	Marguerite 05:07:19 pm
	
		Got it. How many of those items are those? 
	

	Genel Thompson 05:08:17 pm
	
		I archived quite  a few. I could maybe figure out which ones but don't think I can remember the counts that were entered
	

	Marguerite 05:10:22 pm
	
		I see. We might be able to salvage them but I'll have to work with the engineering team which may not be until tomorrow. Is this something that can wait until then? 
	

	Genel Thompson 05:11:42 pm
	
		Absolutely. Do you need a contact number? I won't be in the office but I can give you my cell number
	

	Marguerite 05:12:18 pm
	
		Is 219 484-1607 correct? 
	

	Genel Thompson 05:12:24 pm
	
		Yep
	

	Marguerite 05:12:48 pm
	
		Awesome. I'll let you know as soon as possible tomorrow.
	
		Thanks for chatting in!
	

	Genel Thompson 05:13:17 pm

	Melissa Phillips 12:21:25 pm
	
		Hi there- just a quick question! When we are entering our invoices into the system, I assume we should be using the pre-discount price as the ?Unit Price? and then adding any discounts under ?Adjustments?, correct? If we do it this way, which cost will the system use to calculate the unit price for inventory valuation?

		Hi Melissa! Give me a second to catch up...
	
		Great question. 
	
		Let me just double-check with the team here which way you should do it if you want the actual price you paid to be the one used for future calculations of that product
	
		(I assume that's the goal, right?)
	

	Melissa Phillips 12:27:14 pm
	
		Sounds good, thank you!

		Hey Anton! I'm not sure if we got cut off earlier or if i accidentally hit the wrong button. Still curious if you found anything else with my high negative usage. I also notice my cart builder was showing that i sold through more product than i had on hand? For example is said i went through 9 cases of Ultra when I didn't have nearly that much in stock....
	

	Anton 12:44:36 pm
	
		Hello again! Let me look into the cart build situation as well, im still looking into the negative usage question from earlier
	
		I appreciate your patience while I figure this out
	
		I do notice there is 2 inventories that were done back on the 21st and 22nd, with you doing a weekly inventory would this possibly have caused some discrepancy with the counting and therefor be the issue with the negative usage?
	

	Shannon Standhart 12:58:38 pm
	
		Ahhhh i see, that could be totally what it is.
	
		What would be the best way to fix this? I'm still getting familiar with diving deeper into this
	

	Anton 01:02:55 pm
	
		I'm going to ask my team to check what the best answer is for this, is the email you provided the best way to get in touch with you?
	

	Shannon Standhart 01:06:00 pm
	
		yes perfect thank you!

		tremont cafe
	
		You?re there still?
	

	Anton 03:51:34 pm
	
		Yes sorry, was pulling up the page. If you go into the Order history page
	

	joshua fevens 03:52:18 pm
	
		I just recorded an invoice but did not enter the items just uploaded a photo and dates and invoice #
	
		Then I searched for the invoice and was unable to pull it up?
	

	Anton 03:53:48 pm
	
		Ok you just need to still enter in the information into the invoice, the picture upload is just an electronic record of having the invoice
	

	joshua fevens 03:54:13 pm
	
		Right how do I enter that information? Edit invoice?
	

	Anton 03:55:25 pm
	
		If you click on the name of the vendor right in the Order History page you should be able to add all the items you received. 
	

	joshua fevens 03:56:13 pm
	
		I will need to leave this conversation to attempt so...
	
		open bevspot
	

	Anton 03:56:27 pm
	
		Sure no problem, if you cant access it just let us know here
	
		Orders
	

	joshua fevens 03:56:48 pm
	
		go to order history
	

	Anton 03:56:51 pm
	
		History
	

	joshua fevens 03:56:59 pm
	
		then record invoice
	
		then how do I enter items from there
	

	Anton 03:57:28 pm
	
		there should be an add item button which will allow you to fill in the information
	

	joshua fevens 03:58:23 pm
	
		ok I will look thanks I did one invoice on the computer but it?s inefficient if in need pictures.
	

	Anton 03:58:48 pm
	
		Let us know if you need anymore help!
	

	joshua fevens 03:59:30 pm
	
		No add item tab
	

	Anton 04:00:19 pm
	
		Did you click into the vendor on the history page?
	

	joshua fevens 04:05:15 pm
	
		Did not work
	
		The invoice is not coming up
	
		Is it different on the phone?
	

	Anton 04:07:38 pm
	
		It should be the same interface on the phone. Let me check with my team to see if we can figure this out.
	
		So you went into the vendor and clicked on the attach file to upload your picture and it didnt work or is the editing the items for your invoice didnt work?
	

	joshua fevens 04:11:48 pm
	
		https://cdn.livechat-static.com/api/file/lc/att/7006471/5108a1d96e5b29f6971ba7e5a4b2dbd4/0622DD5B-3C03-44D8-801C-9E911CA05DA1.png
	
		I?m seeing this where do I add items
	

	Anton 04:13:55 pm
	
		So this page just allows you to upload the image of the Invoice, you still need to go into the Orders tab on the left and go into History to then add the information about the items to complete the Invoice
	

	joshua fevens 04:16:21 pm
	
		Got it thanks

		I am curious about food inventory
	
		I was told we can do that as well?
	

	Victoria 09:41:15 am
	
		Hey Jason! You most definitely can use BevSpot to take inventory of your food products, What is the name of your account? 
	

	Jason Clifford 09:41:38 am
	
		We have 3 but I only need it for ?FP Hideout?
	
		so we can get an accurate COGS for food using bevspot?
	
		the other two locations don?t serve food just the one
	

	Victoria 09:43:25 am
	
		Yes, you would be able to get an accurate COGS
	

	Jason Clifford 09:43:41 am
	
		    Awesome
	
		is there an additional cost for this?
	

	Victoria 09:47:02 am
	
		Yes, there is, but since you already have a beverage account we can get that set up - my colleague Rob can give you a call if you are free to go over this information with you. Don't worry, he's on our support team, not the sales team. 
	

	Jason Clifford 09:47:29 am
	
		Sounds good!

	Anton 01:39:37 pm
	
		Give me a minute to pull this up and take a look
	

	Carlos Pretelt 01:39:58 pm
	
		ok...thanks
	
		Could you see the inventory information...
	
		you can use the last one... we did last saturday
	

	Anton 01:52:19 pm
	
		Negative usage could reflect a missing order or was there a possible error in counting?
	

	Carlos Pretelt 01:53:41 pm
	
		but there is not an error counting.-.. we verified it
	
		the order could be...
	
		but there are items... we register the order... but still the usage show negative
	
		that why we are confuse
	

	Anton 01:57:30 pm
	
		Since you are doing partial inventories Bevspot is assuming you are going through all of those items you are not counting during that count and registering them as a 0. This is what's causing all the negative usage.
	
		What you could do for future counts is to copy your previous count before the next inventory by going into the storage area and clicking on the 3 dots in the top right and Copy previous count. Do this for every storage area then manually change the Items you are counting at the time.
	

	Carlos Pretelt 02:01:34 pm
	
		We thought we could do partial inventory ..
	
		when we made support meeting add the beginning ...they told us that
	
		that why we click on partial inventory...the system will understand ... that we want only the items we count...doesnt it?
	

	Anton 02:05:09 pm
	
		I'm going to check with my Team to reach an answer for you, is this the best email to reach you? carlosp@agronosotros.com
	

	Carlos Pretelt 02:05:30 pm
	
		yes..it is
	

	Anton 02:07:11 pm
	
		We will get back to you as soon as we can, thank you for your patience
	

	Carlos Pretelt 02:08:34 pm
	
		ok...

	Maurice Roisman 10:46:03 am
	
		Good morning, a couple things.  First, I resent my pmix yesterday afternoon when I found the one I sent was incomplete.  Has someone had the opportunity to integrate it for last week's sales report?
	

	Victoria 10:47:13 am
	
		Hi Maurice - Thank you for chatting in. I'm going to touch base with my team and get an answer for you about this.  Hang tight for one moment 
	

	Maurice Roisman 10:49:20 am
	
		No problem,  the other issue is with transfers between us and our sister restaurants.  When I initiate the transfer on my side they don't see it but when they initiate it, it appears on both sides.  Somehow the inventories are not linked correctly
	

	Victoria 10:53:22 am
	
		Ok, now Is this for every time you try to initiate a transfer from your location, and are there any specific items in particular? 
	

	Maurice Roisman 10:56:01 am
	
		The most common is Coffee Tequila to Park Tavern or El Camino Blanco to Cut 432
	

	Victoria 10:56:44 am
	
		Do you transfer from your location to all the other locations, or only to specific locations in the group? 
	

	Maurice Roisman 10:57:22 am
	
		Could potentially be to any, but the issues I have are usually with Park or Cut
	

	Victoria 10:59:43 am
	
		Ok. Can you refresh your BevSpot account and now try to initiate a transfer again. 
	

	Maurice Roisman 11:00:54 am
	
		log out and back in or just reload the page
	

	Victoria 11:01:16 am
	
		try to reload the page 
	

	Maurice Roisman 11:03:05 am
	
		I see other options below on the pull down that I have never used before.  I wonder if there are multiple identities for the other stores in my system
	
		I think it worked using one of the new ones since it asked me to add item on the other side.
	

	Victoria 11:07:11 am
	
		Perfect! I spoke with one of my team members and he said that should solve the problem. If, for some reason you run into this issue again, please feel free to reach back out and well take another look into your transfer section! In regards to your sales report, I do see the file that was sent over yesterday. I'm going to just double-check and make sure this was run properly and then ill have you take a look to make sure it looks ok for you! 
	

	Maurice Roisman 11:11:29 am
	
		The correct version was sent around 4pm EST
	

	Victoria 11:16:17 am
	
		Yes, Thank you for this information. I just uploaded the file to this week's sales report and everything looks good on my end. If you are seeing anything that looks off, please feel free to let me know and we can take a look

		Hi! I have quite a few recipes that are attached to a serving. How do I see what is in the serving? I am looking in items and recipes but cannot figure it out. Thanks!
	

	Victoria 12:02:48 pm
	
		Hi Whitney - Thanks for chatting in!

	Victoria 12:03:30 pm
	
		Perfect! Hang tight for one moment while I bring up your account 
	

	Whitney Leliefeld 12:03:38 pm
	
		ok thanks
	

	Victoria 12:08:20 pm
	
		Taking a look into your account, I'm currently not seeing any recipes. Is there a specific one you were referencing? 
	

	Whitney Leliefeld 12:09:02 pm
	
		Im in the Twigs- Valley location and looking at the Lavender Lady and the recipe is 1 serving. But I can't see what the serving is...
	

	Victoria 12:15:46 pm
	
		Ok, thank you for this info. I am currently looking into that account now and I do see the Lavender Lady drink.
	
		If you are looking at the recipes section this item should be highlighted in blue. If you click on that item it will pull up a tab that includes the sale price, cost percentage, etc. Underneath the item name ""Lavender Lady"" you should see blue dotted lines, if you hover over that line it is showing that the lavender lady consists of one serving of 1.5 fl. oz Empress 1908 Gin
	

	Whitney Leliefeld 12:17:27 pm
	
		Ha yes. That was way to easy. I was overthinking it. Thank you so much!
	

	Victoria 12:17:43 pm
	
		You are so welcome! I'm happy to help!
	

	Whitney Leliefeld 12:17:50 pm

		BevSpot Support here! How can we help?
	

	Carlos Pretelt 03:24:58 pm
	
		Hello Victoria...
	
		the Id is:

theperfectpa1
	
		I want to understand ... something about the inventory
	

	Victoria 03:25:53 pm
	
		Hi Carlos - Thanks for chatting in! What can I help you with!
	

	Carlos Pretelt 03:26:58 pm
	
		in meetings with bevspot support ... they told us ...when we make a tranfer in bevspot the system understand We prepare an item
	
		and used the ingredients........
	
		so the iventory will be real...when we count
	
		but..... today we made the sales for that products... so I tranfer ""back"" the items ...and  then register the sale (we use lightspeed like POS connected to bevspot)
	
		But I still see when I go to Inventory (Expected inventory) it show up the 1,600 bars for example the 80
	
		80% chocolate bar
	
		the question....WHY?
	

	Victoria 03:32:17 pm
	
		Thank you for this information. I'm going to open up and take a look into your account, hang tight for one moment, please. 
	

	Carlos Pretelt 03:34:19 pm
	
		right now... i see ....that especific item ...is ""unmapped""....probably that teh problem...
	
		but still please look it up
	

	Victoria 03:40:59 pm
	
		Yes, that is correct. Based on the information I am seeing in your account, you do have a few items that need to be mapped. 
	
		I am going to circle up with my freemium team and have them take a look into this as well. In the meantime, if you could try mapping those specific items that would be great! 
	

	Carlos Pretelt 03:47:45 pm
	
		i just mapped....
	
		the problem or question is to know if the system will take the sales made before I mapped??
	
		especific with 

Chocolate bar 80% 80gr
Chocolate bar 57% 80gr
Chocolate bar 44% 80gr
White bar 80gr
	

	Victoria 03:50:35 pm
	
		Yes, whatever time frame you set your sales for, it will pull that sales data over. Even if its before you mapped it ?
	

	Carlos Pretelt 03:51:15 pm
	
		ok.. so I will go out of bevspot and get in again...
	
		to see if get update...or should I wait for an especific time?
	

	Victoria 03:55:02 pm
	
		I dont think you would need to wait for a specific time, would you be able to provide more detail on what exactly you mean by going out of bevspot and back in again 
	

	Carlos Pretelt 03:55:24 pm
	
		ok...
	
		thank you Victoria..

	Victoria 11:39:34 am

	Justin Rexroad 11:40:38 am
	
		So I just click record and its done?

		Hi Mark - Thanks for chatting in
	

	Mark LaGrange 11:56:14 am
	
		On the last sales report I am missing some sales items.
	

	Victoria 11:56:55 am
	
		Ok, let's take a look into this. Could you please provide me with your account name
	

	Mark LaGrange 11:57:13 am
	
		mark lagrange
	
		Canoe Club Wine Bar
	

	Victoria 11:58:30 am
	
		Thank you for this information. Hang tight for one moment while I pull up your account 
	
		Could you please provide me the items that you currently are not seeing in your sales items 
	

	Mark LaGrange 11:59:32 am
	
		Catawba Island
Walleye PA IPA
	
		Great Lakes Brewing Co.
Conway's Irish Ale
	

	Victoria 12:07:41 pm
	
		As I'm taking a look into the account the first thing I noticed was, Catawba Island seems to be a deleted recipe. 
	
		You can restore this recipe and then add that item to your sales report. Is that something you feel comfortable doing? 
	

	Mark LaGrange 12:10:27 pm
	
		I took out the recipe because catawba island has several beers and they all were under the same brewery.  I wanted the sales catawba brewing hot blonde to come up under the pos data so i coud create the correct recipe and it did not
	
		toast send it as catawba hot blonde but bevspot does not relay that sales when i do a new sales report
	

	Victoria 12:13:26 pm
	
		Catawba hot blonde seems to be an Archived item, this item would need to be unarchived to be viewed on sales reports. 
	

	Mark LaGrange 12:14:08 pm
	
		why would bevspot tell me it was an unmapped item?
	

	Victoria 12:15:45 pm
	
		Could you provide a screenshot where it is telling you that the item is unmapped, I'm currently not seeing that information in the account. 
	

	Mark LaGrange 12:16:41 pm
	
		I meant why would it not?  If i redid the sales report the sales should have been there and not had a recipe if I deleted it
	
		we have been dealing with catawba brewing beers for weeks because any beer we sold was the same if it began with catawba brewing and they have many beers.  they were always the same item in bevspot
	
		I needed seperate recipes
	
		catawba brewing hot blonde had sales the week of mar-10 in toast.  they do not show up in bevspot pos data
	
		i have called andrew dodd twice about this.  can i talk to someone to get this fixed?
	
		He doesnt call me back
	

	Victoria 12:24:34 pm
	
		I went in and added catawba hot blonde back to your report, it is showing as mapped but I also do not see any units sold. I think this would be a great opportunity to schedule some time with our specialist, Nick. He would be able to help resolve this better than me. If you would like me to send over his calendar link, you can pick a date and time that works best for you!?
	

	Mark LaGrange 12:25:25 pm
	
		yes

		i switched from nick to andrew because I wanted better support.  can i get someone else
	

	Victoria 12:28:36 pm
	
		I completely understand where you're coming from, with wanting same-day help. 
	
		Let me talk to my team and see who can better assist you today.
	

	Mark LaGrange 12:32:43 pm
	
		I am asking why one item in my toast sales is not in bevspot sales and 30 minutes and no one knows

		Great, give me a min to pull this up
	

	Nicholas Senneca 02:57:35 pm
	
		ok
	
		everything seems very weird on the report not sure
	

	Anton 02:59:38 pm
	
		Which report are you looking at so I can look as well?
	

	Nicholas Senneca 02:59:58 pm
	
		sales report 3.8-3.15
	

	Anton 03:01:41 pm
	
		Ok let me take a look.
	

	Nicholas Senneca 03:04:59 pm
	
		also how do i get certain items to pull on my reports that have not been pulling weekly.
	

	Anton 03:08:31 pm
	
		Under the POS data Tab in the top right corner there is a add items to report button you can add any item you would like to see on the reports. 
	

	Nicholas Senneca 03:08:53 pm
	
		i added certain items this week but its not pulling onto this report
	

	Anton 03:09:23 pm
	
		Can you give me an example of something that you entered but it did not show in the report?
	

	Nicholas Senneca 03:10:00 pm

		both not pulling weekly
	
		but i add it eery week
	

	Anton 03:15:29 pm
	
		Thank you for your patience as I look into this.
	

	Nicholas Senneca 03:15:36 pm
	
		np
	
		did we figure out why alot of my items are saying NA
	
		oh and my system is not letting me archive or unarchive items
	
		There was a problem with the last action you took. Please refresh the page and try again.

If you have any questions, or if this issue persists, please contact us at support@bevspot.com or call (617) 658-3123
	
		keeps saying this
	

	Anton 03:20:40 pm
	
		For the N/A in your variance reports if you go back into the recipe and edit the unit cost it should clear up the N/A in the reports. The Archiving in recipes problem is being looked into by our team and we will let you know when it is resolved.
	

	Nicholas Senneca 03:21:08 pm
	
		what about the cranberry
	

	Anton 03:21:33 pm
	
		I will try to add it to the report now and see if it shows up on my end
	

	Nicholas Senneca 03:21:34 pm
	
		and ih ave one more question after
	
		i have an item pulling from two buffalo traces and i cant figure out why
	
		its pulling from one item and not the other and when i look for it i cant find out why and i am not sure if it is because its not pulling
	
		or letting me unarchive
	

	Anton 03:24:06 pm
	
		It looked like they were not added so I went and added them to this week, if you could refresh your page and let me know if you see them now.
	
		I can see there are two recipes for buffalo trace, one the regular price and one the happy hour price , do you have seperate buttons for these prices in your POS? 
	

	Nicholas Senneca 03:30:46 pm
	
		yes
	
		imn adding prices to the recipes and its still not pulling its weird
	

	Anton 03:39:14 pm
	
		I see the two recipes HH Buffalo Trace and Buffalo trace, is this what you are referring to? They both seem to be pulling from the one Item Buffalo Trace
	

	Nicholas Senneca 03:39:35 pm
	
		no i meant for the NA issue
	

	Anton 03:41:57 pm
	
		Can you give me a few items you have changed the pricing of so I can see if it is taking effect?
	

	Nicholas Senneca 03:42:56 pm
	
		vanilla ban paste
	
		bean
	
		lwr craft clips
	
		Sumatra blend
	
		i added pricing cause they were 0
	
		and i made sure it was pulling from recipes i used last week too
	

	Anton 03:46:34 pm
	
		I need to talk to our engineering team to figure out the archiving issue and I will speak to Brian about the issues with your sales report, can I contact you at the email nicholas@elcaminoftlauderdale.com ?
	

	Nicholas Senneca 03:46:40 pm
	
		yes
	

	Anton 03:46:58 pm
	
		Great, you will hear from us soon. Thank you for your patience.

	Michael Garner 11:56:18 am
	
		How do I rearrange the order in which items appear when doing inventory??  I can't remember!!!
	

	Victoria 11:56:22 am
	
		Hi Michael - Thanks for chatting in!  
	
		What you will want to do once you are in the ""start count"" section, go to the left-hand side of the page where you can click on ""View filters"", once you get there you will then be able to toggle between the different ways to view your items. 
	

	Michael Garner 12:00:11 pm
	
		Seems like the last time i started an inventory, it messed us up when it came time to do our regular Monday inventory.  If I start a count, can I cancel it??
	

	Victoria 12:02:18 pm
	
		We don't have a cancel button, but we do have a delete option available.
	
		Are you looking to organize your items in a specific order for taking inventory?
	

	Michael Garner 12:03:29 pm
	
		Yes!  Things get moved around and inventory doesn't get recorded properly because items are out of order
	

	Victoria 12:03:54 pm
	
		Gotcha! We can definitely fix this for you!! 
	
		Do you have some time to jump on a quick call to walk through this process? If not I can definitely type out the steps for you. 
	
		Whatever works best for you! 
	

	Michael Garner 12:05:13 pm
	
		call is preferred
	
		515-710-5086
	

	Victoria 12:06:26 pm
	
		Perfect! I will be reaching out momentarily, In the meantime, could you please provide me with the account you are associated with

		Hi Craig - Just a quick question. Would you be able to send over the PMIX file for your sales report ending on the 15th? 
	
		The most recent PMIX we have is from the 9th. 
	

	Craig Neubecker 02:54:50 pm
	
		It is auto sent to you from TouchBistro POS each week (on Tuesdays I believe).
	

	Victoria 02:57:12 pm
	
		Ok - At the moment our team does not have the file for this most recent week. Would you be ok with us reaching out to you once this file is sent over? 
	
		We will be sure to run it same day as it comes in!
	

	Craig Neubecker 02:58:03 pm
	
		I'll look into getting it resent
	

	Victoria 02:58:51 pm
	
		Perfect! Thank you, if we see anything come in on our end before then, we will give you an update! 
	

	Craig Neubecker 02:59:47 pm
	
		I just forwarded a copy of the email to support@bevspot.com

	Victoria 04:49:34 pm
	
		We can definitely take care of this!  Go into your order history section, on the top right-hand side you will see a button for you to record the invoice, once you click on that it will bring you to a page where you will then select the vendor and then click "" record invoice and edit"". You will then be able to enter in any adjustments from your paper invoice to match within your BevSpot account as well as set the appropriate time stamp.

		For Nosh & Grog
	

	Victoria 03:54:10 pm
	
		Hey Craig - Thanks for chatting in, hang tight for one moment while I take a look into this for you
	
		Hey Craig - Thank you for waiting. After taking a look into your account the best way to fix these uncategorized items will be to go in and map them. 
	

	Craig Neubecker 04:30:31 pm
	
		? As in search the item in <Items and Recipes>, <Recipes> and then add the ingrendts?  Or is there someplace I define that it is a beer, a wine, a liquor etc?
	
		Or can you give me steps to map them?
	

	Victoria 04:44:24 pm
	
		What you will want to do is, refresh your page then go into your sales history section, click into that most recent sales report, and then at the top of the page it is going to prompt you to map the 28 items. Once you do that it should then categorize them. 
	
		Let me know if you need help mapping the POS ID to the correct recipe within BevSpot 
	

	Craig Neubecker 05:02:55 pm
	
		Got it - in the past when I went to that page I saw the Scattegram itme sales/cgs chart.  Sorry I'm a bit confused.  Where is that vs this page you directed me to?
	

	Marguerite 05:04:43 pm
	
		Hi Craig! That makes sense. We actually switched you to our new sales reporting format which we thought would help you be able to more easily map your items. 
	

	Craig Neubecker 05:05:34 pm
	
		Yes, that was helpful.  But I'm a big fan of the scattergram sales/cgs chart.  Can I still access that?
	

	Marguerite 05:07:47 pm
	
		I can change ya back if you want! Did you map all the recipes you needed to before I do? 
	

	Craig Neubecker 05:08:11 pm
	
		yes - thank you

		Hello!  How do I show items i've ordered without using the invoice processing feature?
	

	Victoria 08:14:21 am
	
		Hi Christy - thanks for chatting in! 
	
		Are you looking to confirm the orders you received? Or just looking to see your items in general?
	

	Christy Hackinson 08:17:40 am
	
		I entered my inventory last night and i got a delivery this morning.  I want to add those to my inventory and track the price changes
	

	Victoria 08:19:12 am
	
		Is this an order that you either placed or recorded within BevSpot 
	

	Christy Hackinson 08:19:23 am
	
		i placed
	

	Victoria 08:20:39 am
	
		Perfect! What you will want to do is go into your inventory history, click into that order that you want to edit and from there you will be able to edit price changes or quantity changes. 
	

	Christy Hackinson 08:22:27 am
	
		so basically there isnt a way to enter it as an invoice rather than just changing my current inventory?
	
		I recorded the invoice but can I attach products to that invoice?
	
		oh wait
	

	Victoria 08:24:49 am
	
		Yes you can attach products to that invoice by clicking "" add items"" 
	

	Christy Hackinson 08:25:29 am
	
		got it!
	
		that's what i needed!  Thanks!

	Anton 02:54:13 pm
	
		Hi Michael, let me look into this, are you unable to click into the report itself or don't even see the option to run the report?
	

	Michael Ferrie 03:01:44 pm
	
		No option I can see
	

	Anton 03:04:18 pm
	
		So on the left hand side of the menu you cannot even see the transfer report option? Just to make sure you are in Caledonia UES? 
	

	Michael Ferrie 03:07:52 pm
	
		correct, when I click reports I only see cost of goods sold
	

	Anton 03:09:47 pm
	
		Can you try clearing your cache and cookies and refreshing the page? I just reset the access to the report so it should be available now

		If I sell a bottle of wine at cost to move dead stock how can I record that in Bevspot? I was thinking to just record it as breakage.
	

	Victoria 02:15:23 pm
	
		Hey Matt - Thanks for chatting in! 
	
		Hang tight for one moment while I take a look into the best way of recording this item
	
		Are you selling this bottle at cost through your POS or are you just transferring this bottle and recording it as a sale else where? 
	
		If you record this bottle as a loss you can create a loss category titled "" Sold At Cost"" and this would be in your inventory history page, then clicking on record loss.

	Victoria 03:43:46 pm
	
		Ok - Thank you for clearing this up! I do see this item, I was able to Unarchive it within the items section. On the recipes section, I am unable to unarchive that recipe for Btl-Pacifico. I just sent out an email to my engineering team to see why we are both unable to unarchive the recipe. For the time being, I would suggest creating a new recipe for that item Btl-Pacifico and we will let you know once we receive an answer as to why you were unable to unarchive that recipe.

		Hey Craig,  In the item card where is says price if you change that to price per can instead of price per case it should clear up this issue, it will still be marked as comes as a case.
	

	Craig Neubecker 04:55:04 pm
	
		So for all items enter the cost per can or bottle and not our cost per case?
	
		Cost per a case (or as BS calls it ""price"" per case) is shown as an option and is how we place our orders
	

	Anton 04:56:52 pm
	
		Yes, the item card will show if it comes as a case and will still give you the information of how much a case will cost. If it is marked as comes as a case that shouldn't affect the ordering of the item.
	

	Craig Neubecker 04:57:41 pm
	
		So I should not enter cost per case, only enter cost per can/bottle???
	

	Anton 04:58:05 pm
	
		If you enter the price per item, and mark it as comes as a case the item card will tell you the price of the unit as well as the price per case
	

	Craig Neubecker 04:58:36 pm
	
		ok - have a good night

		BevSpot Support here! How can we help?
	

	Nicholas Senneca 03:04:13 pm
	
		Sorry got disconnected
	

	Annie 03:04:22 pm
	
		No worries! Which item are you trying to unarchive?
	

	Nicholas Senneca 03:04:34 pm
	
		Pacifico
	
		item number =95
	
		under recipes
	

	Annie 03:05:12 pm
	
		I'll look now!
	
		I'm getting the same error message
	
		I'll reach out to engineering as this has been a bug with some other accounts as well.
	

	Nicholas Senneca 03:08:13 pm
	
		i been getting it every week
	
		it?s not showing usage because of this
	

	Annie 03:14:29 pm
	
		I will make sure to make note of that! Thanks for bearing with us
	

	Nicholas Senneca 03:15:07 pm
	
		okay I have more more question I swear
	
		and I won?t bother you
	
		you are just the only one who is actually helping me
	

	Annie 03:15:33 pm
	
		No worries! Happy to help!
	

	Nicholas Senneca 03:16:24 pm
	
		These items other then the craneo never pull weekly no one can figure why I ask every week. Maybe you can help figure out why it doesn?t pull

		It?s mostly just the cranberry juice not the cocktails
	

	Annie 03:21:01 pm
	
		Do you know the POS ID of the cranberry juice?
	

	Nicholas Senneca 03:21:23 pm
	
		1085
	
		87
	
		are the two ids
	

	Annie 03:24:24 pm
	
		Thanks for those!
	
		It looks like the 1085 cranberry is actually pulling - seeing 36 sold

	Nicholas Senneca 03:27:27 pm
	
		I just ,annually entered it
	
		i have to do it weekly
	
		that?s why it shows it?s pulling sorry I shouldn?t of added it
	

	Annie 03:29:38 pm
	
		No worries! Looking further into it
	
		Think we found the problem! Those recipes were omitted from being mapped. This shouldn't be an issue going forward. If there is another issue it's a pretty simple fix from your end! ""Sales"" ->  ""Settings"" -> ""View and manage omitted items"". You can restore your items from there!
	

	Nicholas Senneca 03:34:34 pm
	
		oh ok
	
		sweet
	
		that?s good to know
	
		I love how you answer all my questions but no one else could
	
		?
	

	Annie 03:37:22 pm
	
		Happy to help!
	
		Anything else we can help you with today?

		Hello, my account is saying payment missed but we paid in full on March 18th check #13919 orginal invoice number was 11232
	

	Victoria 11:00:07 am
	
		Hi Patrick - Thanks for chatting in! Hang tight for one moment while I take a look into this for you?
	
		Hey Patrick, thank you for waiting. I spoke with your account manager Brain and he has asked me to give you his calendar link to schedule sometime to go over this information with you in more detail. https://app.hubspot.com/meetings/brian411 
	
		If you need any help scheduling a time within that link I am more than happy to do so! 
	

	Patrick Wynn 11:18:29 am
	
		For our payment?
	

	Victoria 11:20:05 am
	
		Yes, that is correct. On the customer support side, I do not have access to payment information. That would need to be further discussed with your account manager. 
	

	Patrick Wynn 11:21:00 am
	
		Ok Thanks

	charlie barone 02:05:30 pm
	
		Good afternoon Annie.  I have a submitted invoice from 5 days ago that still has not been processed.  I need it to go through, as our inventory is due this evening.  Is there a way to push it through ASAP?
	
		Or, if not, is there a way to delete the invoice and the charge for it so I can manually enter it?
	

	Annie 02:07:24 pm
	
		Hi Jonathan! Let me take a look at that for you!

	Annie 02:13:37 pm
	
		Thanks for your patience! Sorry about the delay! I'm not sure why that happened, but Nick, and our support team are happy to take care of that for you.  
	

	charlie barone 02:14:23 pm
	
		Excellent.  As in it will be processed?  Or it will be deleted for manual entry?
	

	Annie 02:15:11 pm
	
		We will take care of entering it manually on our end. It will be done by end of day for you!

	Lahni Stellmacker  12:24:10 pm
	
		No problem
	

	Rob 12:25:35 pm
	
		Have you gone over building recipes on your last training? Or would this be the first time diving into those for you
	

	Lahni Stellmacker  12:26:09 pm
	
		First time
	

	Rob 12:29:06 pm
	
		Oh great - that's a wonderful next step within your BevSpot account.  I'm just speaking with Victoria, with whom you have been training, to set up some time accordingly as I think that building out your recipes would be better suited for a training call than on chat
	
		Do you have some time tomorrow morning to go over a more detailed recipe training?  If so I can send a calendar invite with a link so that we can better walk through this for you!
	

	Lahni Stellmacker  12:34:25 pm
	
		I know how to build the recipes I just need to know how to get the recipes tab to pop up so I can get started.
	

	Rob 12:34:53 pm

		for restaurant?   i have 3 logins - golf - retail - restaurant
	

	Rob 10:00:28 am
	
		Are they all connected to the same Lightspeed? As in, if the information will be pulling from LS it shouldn't much matter which you log into, but maybe suggest trying the restaurant login

		hi anton is Annie working today
	

	Anton 01:50:00 pm
	
		She is not in today, maybe I can help?
	

	Nicholas Senneca 01:50:17 pm
	
		trying to figure out how come my sangria is not pulling
	
		every inventory
	
		Its most likely not mapped correctly.
	

	Anton 01:51:37 pm
	
		Are you recording the batch everytime you make the sangria or is this a premade item?
	

	Nicholas Senneca 01:52:28 pm
	
		its not a premade item
	
		its a cocktail we use
	

	Anton 01:53:19 pm
	
		So you are not taking inventory of the Sangria, did you mean it is not showing up in a report?
	

	Nicholas Senneca 01:53:56 pm
	
		i have to manually add it to the report everytime
	
		when it should be pulling from the report to here
	

	Anton 01:55:42 pm
	
		Ok let me look into this real quick so I can figure out what is causing this.
	

	Nicholas Senneca 01:56:51 pm
	
		no worries
	
		i think its just not mapped properly or something
	

	Anton 02:01:55 pm
	
		It seems to be mapped and is pulling, I am looking into why it is being omitted from the report.
	

	Nicholas Senneca 02:02:05 pm
	
		i added it
	
		to this one to help my counts
	
		but it just doesnt pull regularly
	

	Anton 02:16:42 pm
	
		It seems like it was not added, I went ahead and added it to future reports so you should be all set going forward.

		I will let you know as soon as I do.
	

	charlie barone 02:02:21 pm
	
		I suppose the only other question I have in the meantime is whether there is a way for me to just enter the invoice manually?
	

	Anton 02:05:47 pm

		Hey Jonathan, that invoice has been processed manually and will be included on the last inventory you took. We will go in and delete that processing request. This should clear everything up for you.

		BevSpot Support here! How can we help?
	

	NAtalie Manion 02:53:52 pm
	
		Hello
	
		I went to finish count on an inventory and a whole section got ""archieved"" And I lost all the product in the current inveentory
	

	Anton 02:55:36 pm
	
		Hello Natalie, give me a moment to open your account and take a look at what happened. This is the most recent Inventory correct?
	

	NAtalie Manion 02:56:10 pm
	
		Yes that was in progress
	
		There was a section called ""Initial inventory items to ignore"" that has about 224 items in there
	
		It was accidentally archieved
	
		But changed the totals from other sections that has already been counted
	
		All the liquors and spirits are gone from the counted invenrory
	

	Anton 02:59:04 pm
	
		So when you archived the items, it removed other items from the counted Inventory, are these the same items in different locations or are these different items entirely?
	

	NAtalie Manion 02:59:16 pm
	
		Same items in different locations
	
		and when that section was archieve it removed them from the other locations
	
		that were already counted
	

	Anton 03:01:35 pm
	
		Let me check to see if we can get those items back, give me a few minutes to look into this. 
	

	NAtalie Manion 03:01:53 pm
	
		Okay thank you!
	

	Anton 03:02:46 pm
	
		If you need to leave or this takes longer than expected, can I reach you by email?
	

	NAtalie Manion 03:02:50 pm
	
		yes
	
		natalie@turksnyc.com
	
		I appreciate it
	
		I just really would be so sad if I had to redo inventory
	
		haha
	

	Anton 03:03:32 pm
	
		Perfect, thank you, I will let you know as soon as I figure it out, I would be sad for you too, no one should have to do inventory twice

		BevSpot Support here! How can we help?
	

	Chris Plattner 10:04:20 am
	
		We completed an inventory yesterday for food and it appears to be missing this morning?
	

	Victoria 10:04:43 am
	
		Hi Chris - Thank you for chatting in, Hang tight for one moment while I pull up your account.
	
		In the meantime, were you offline by any chance when taking this inventory? 
	

	Chris Plattner 10:05:51 am
	
		I don't believe so.  I did take it on a mobile device, but finished looking at it from my desktop.
	

	Victoria 10:06:10 am
	
		Ok - no worries, one moment while I take a look into this for you
	
		At approximately what time did you take this inventory yesterday?
	

	Chris Plattner 10:11:41 am
	
		I was done by 11:00am and then made some changes throughout the day.
	
		My ipad screen say last updated at 10:56am and all changes saved.
	

	Victoria 10:12:47 am
	
		Ok thank you for this information
	
		I am currently relaying this information over to our engineering team as I do not see an inventory within your account either. Would you have an email address that works best, for us to reach out to once we resolve this problem for you. 
	

	Chris Plattner 10:19:42 am
	
		chris.plattner@tshotz.com
	

	Victoria 10:20:51 am
	
		Perfect, thank you. I will send any updates to this address from our support@bevspot.com email. Please be on the lookout for a response before the end of today. 
	

	Chris Plattner 10:23:50 am
	
		Ok - in looking at my ipad screen my inventory is on there, but it was also on the my desktop yesterday that I made changes to.
	

	Victoria 10:25:35 am
	
		This information will be super helpful for our engineering team. Thank you. Are you able to click into the inventory from your IPad? 
	

	Chris Plattner 10:25:55 am
	
		yes.
	
		but it looks like all the changes I made are not showing
	

	Victoria 10:26:52 am
	
		Ok and what is the date on that inventory you are clicking into?
	

	Chris Plattner 10:28:15 am
	
		it has a different time for each storage area, but the date on all is April 01, 2021
	

	Victoria 10:31:55 am
	
		Can you take a screenshot of the iPad view of that inventory please and send it through this chat 
	
		The more information we have to send to our engineering team, the better! 
	

	Chris Plattner 10:35:04 am

		I have had little training on how to use bevspot and kind of winged it.  I wonder if a phone call for some basic best practices might be in order?  The odd thing is that I worked on the inventory from my desktop until 6pm last night and had no issues seeing the inventory?
	

	Victoria 10:37:37 am
	
		Can you try clicking on finish count and see what that does for you
	

	Chris Plattner 10:38:08 am
	
		I am hesitant to do anything until your end knows what the problem is
	

	Victoria 10:40:39 am
	
		I understand, our team is currently not seeing that inventory from the screenshot. Our assumption is, if this inventory from the screenshot above is finalized we may get the chance to see it on our end 
	

	Chris Plattner 10:42:40 am
	
		So they would like me to finish count?
	

	Victoria 10:46:40 am
	
		Chris - Thanks for your patience after speaking with the team I think we know what happened. 
	

	Chris Plattner 10:47:43 am
	
		standing by
	

	Victoria 10:50:51 am
	
		Looks like your count that you were working on was under a 3/1 finalization date which was the root of the confusion here. Moving forward you are able to edit the timestamp of any counts.  In this case the count in question is titled ""cap"". Do you know how to go in and change the date of the count? If not, I'd be more than happy to walk you through it. 
	

	Chris Plattner 10:52:10 am
	
		Please walk me through it.
	

	Victoria 10:52:21 am
	
		Sure thing
	

	Chris Plattner 10:53:21 am

	Victoria 01:26:05 pm
	
		Hello Nicholas - Annie is not in at the moment but is there something I can help you with?
	

	Nicholas Senneca 01:26:29 pm
	
		yes i think my sangria is not mapped correctly
	
		cause it doesnt pull every week
	
		and i have to manuall pull it
	

	Victoria 01:27:28 pm
	
		Hmmm, let's take a look into this. Hang tight for one moment while I pull up your account 
	

	Nicholas Senneca 01:27:38 pm
	
		ok
	

	Victoria 01:29:17 pm
	
		Looking into your account - is this for the HH sangria?
	

	Nicholas Senneca 01:29:47 pm
	
		no
	
		regular sangria
	
		pos id: 3659
	

	Victoria 01:33:38 pm
	
		Ok thank you for this information. Hang tight for one moment t
	

	Nicholas Senneca 01:36:13 pm
	
		thank you
	
		also my espresso martini is doing the same thing
	

	Victoria 01:39:10 pm
	
		When you say you have to manually pull it, Is the item not showing up at all, or it is just showing up incorrectly on your pos data tab? 
	

	Nicholas Senneca 01:42:49 pm
	
		i go to POS dATA
	
		aDD ITEM TO REPORT
	
		its not showing up at all that i see
	

	Victoria 01:45:48 pm
	
		Ok - our team is currently working to solve this problem for you. We do in fact see the sangria item on your PMIX file, however, we are not entirely sure why it is not showing up within your account when the report is run. I am going to have one of my colleagues re-run this report to see if we can find where the problem is stemming from. We will also look into the espresso martini.

	anna swift 05:06:25 pm
	
		hello
	
		we have just completed an inventory and then filled out card to par levels
	
		however the cart builder is not doing that
	
		for example we have 1.2  cases in our inventory and 1case in our par level but it wants to order 1 more case
	

	System 05:09:37 pm
	
		You were transferred to Kendra
	

	Kendra 05:11:47 pm
	
		Thank you for chatting in. I am just going to take a look at your account real quick. 
	

	anna swift 05:11:55 pm
	
		thank you so much
	
		we have spent days trying to work this out
	
		i have corrected a lot on the cart already. but an example would be orchard pig cider under the vendor chappel and jenkins
	
		we have 2 in the inventory and 1 in the par level but it has added one case to the cart
	
		also, if when we look at the cart and realise that the inventory is wrong. for example we accidentalll put 12 cases of apple juice instead of 12 cartons is there any way we can correct the finalised inventory
	

	Kendra 05:18:54 pm
	
		Thank you for this information. For the inventory on apple juice, if it is already finalized then you can go into it and make any adjustments necessary. If it is not finalized you can make that change and then finalize it. 
	

	anna swift 05:21:20 pm
	
		how do you go in and change it. we have been trying to and can't
	
		the main issue is that the cart seems to be adding things above the par levels
	

	Kendra 05:24:35 pm
	
		To change your previously inventory you need to go to the inventory history page. From there you will see the date with the finalized inventory. Click on the date of your processed inventory and once you are in you will click the three vertical dots at the top of the page. Once you click the dots you will see edit and be able to fix the problem. 
	

	anna swift 05:27:50 pm
	
		When I try to click on the date of the inventory in the inventory history page, it does not go to the inventory but rather to an edit count page with no way to actually edit it
	

	Kendra 05:28:40 pm
	
		I have spoken with Marguerite and she will email you today to set up a call for either today or tomorrow. She can better assist you on the par level issues. 
	
		Let me take a look at that for you.
	
		It looks like you can just go to Inventory History, click on the date of inventory, and then you can make the edit right there without actually having to press the three dots in the corner. 
	

	anna swift 05:32:12 pm
	
		ok so i did that and now the whole inventory seems to have wiped and the cart builder has none of the information I previously entered
	
		the inventory I previously did today which took 3 staff to complete over several hours seems to have completely dissapeared
	

	Kendra 05:38:19 pm
	
		 Marguerite can much better assist you with these issues over the phone.  I would just hang tight until she reaches out. 
	

	anna swift 05:38:38 pm
	
		ok i will wait for her call
	
		thank you

		Hi from BevSpot Support! Check out our help center at www.bevspot.com/help or chat us here if you have any questions as you move around the software.
	

	Philip 09:59:38 am
	
		I have 2 issues. Yesterday when I was inputting my invoices for whatever reason an item Topo Chico, which I order almost daily and g\have never had an issue, was not popping up to input. It?s as if it got deleted. So I created a new one and now it?s not showing any deliveries for it so I?m + it on variance. Second one is I have 2 Jameson Caskmates ipa and don?t know which one to delete so it?s recognized correctly
	
		Hello
	

	Rob 10:04:13 am
	
		Hey Philip, let me take a look into this give me just a moment

	Marguerite 10:08:59 am
	
		Let me look into this! One sec... 
	

	Philip 10:10:31 am
	
		thanks. I don?t have a whole lot of time before a meeting
	

	Marguerite 10:16:45 am
	
		Is this for Lost and Found Beverage, Food or Born and Raised? 
	

	Philip 10:16:56 am
	
		Lost
	

	Marguerite 10:20:30 am
	
		Looks like the Topo Chico was deleted on March 31st.

	Philip 10:21:16 am
	
		Ok not too sure why
	

	Marguerite 10:21:55 am
	
		For the Jameson Caskmates IPA, I'd pick one and either have to back date an inventory of it or backdate a weeks worth of orders. 
	
		But then archive the one you don't want active so it still gives you some historical data.
	
		But at least start fresh from one inventory cycle's worth. 
	

	Philip 10:23:05 am
	
		ok I tried that yesterday couldn?t figure it out can you help with both. Like I said I created a new Topo
	
		more importantly the Topo Chico
	

	Marguerite 10:25:54 am
	
		Yeah for sure, I'd be happy to. 
	
		Alright - I archived one of the Jameson Caskmates since you hadn't counted it in the past month whereas the one that's left has some counts associated with it. 
	

	Philip 10:33:27 am
	
		Ok and the Topo?
	

	Marguerite 10:33:46 am
	
		Next on the list! Hold tight. 
	

	Philip 10:33:56 am
	
		?
	

	Marguerite 10:43:08 am
	
		You should be all set. 
	
		I went in and backdated the correct Topo to reflect the counts from last week's count and now the deliveries should be reflected accurately. 
	

	Philip 10:45:20 am
	
		Ok but the sales for it aren?t reflecting now it shows two and a big negative
	

	Marguerite 10:45:50 am
	
		Oh great, glad I was able to make it worse. 
	
		Let me go back in and check. 
	
		We just have to now map the pos id to the correct Topo now.
	
		I will do that - should clear up that variance.

	Jeremy Gifford 10:36:21 am
	
		HI, I am trying to invite a user to have access to both the food and beverage side of Bevspot. SHe now has access to the beverage side but when she tries to get into the food side it says she already has an account. Help?
	

	Anton 10:37:55 am
	
		Hello, I can definitely help with this, what is the name of the account and the email associated with the person needing access to the food side?
	

	Jeremy Gifford 10:38:46 am
	
		laskareid@gmail.com is the email
	

	Anton 10:39:58 am
	
		Ok I am going to cancel the invitation and resend it.
	

	Jeremy Gifford 10:40:14 am
	
		ok thanks
	

	Anton 10:40:35 am
	
		Do you want them to have admin access as you tried earlier or just regular access?
	
		I sent the invitation as regular as we can always change the access later
	

	Jeremy Gifford 10:42:35 am
	
		admin yes
	
		It's asking her to make another account
	
		sorry she didn't see the LOGIN option instead of the create new account option .
	

	Anton 10:44:30 am
	
		Great! I have now put them as Admin access so you should be all set

		BevSpot Support here! How can we help?
	

	Allyx O'Connor 11:20:25 am
	
		Hi! I'm having issues with a couple of vendors not recieving emails directly from bevspot. I've been forwarding them on from my personal email which isn't ideal. Nothing in their junk mail or anything. Can you help me with thsi
	

	Anton 11:22:19 am
	
		Hello, I can help with this, have you checked in the vendors tab to make sure the email address is correct in the contact created for that vendor?
	

	Allyx O'Connor 11:30:07 am
	
		I have
	
		over and over lol
	
		I've even copied it from there to email them from my inbox
	

	Anton 11:33:14 am
	
		Ok, let's try deleting the Vendor and creating a new one and see if that works.
	
		Let me try, Which vendors are you unable to communicate with through bevspot?
	

	Allyx O'Connor 11:36:23 am
	
		The two with issues are Fort George and Clatsop. Additionally, can we add two emails to a vendor? They want it to go to two places
	

	Anton 11:37:18 am
	
		For the adding an email, just add a new rep and they will receive an email when you place an order
	

	Allyx O'Connor 11:37:27 am
	
		great, thank you!
	

	Anton 11:39:35 am
	
		Could you try adding the email under a new rep in that vendor and see if they receive that email?
	
		For Fort George and Clatsop I mean.
	

	Allyx O'Connor 11:55:27 am
	
		sorry for the delays, working. One sec!
	
		I guess I'm not sure what you mean.... Adding another new rep with the same email?
	

	Anton 11:57:30 am
	
		Yes exactly, it might fix this miscommunication problem by adding the new rep within the vendor contact
	

	Allyx O'Connor 11:58:07 am
	
		Should I delete the ""old"" rep?
	

	Anton 11:58:24 am
	
		Once you have the new contact in yes let's try that
	

	Allyx O'Connor 11:59:05 am
	
		It likes to say rep name and email are required and invalid email...but i just copy/pasted
	
		i got it on Fort George but not Clatsop
	
		this was an issue when i set up as well
	
		ok, refreshed and did it again, looks like it worked
	
		is there an easy way to send a test or is it an order?
	

	Anton 12:03:15 pm
	
		Great to hear it worked. I think you will have to send an order and see if it goes through
	

	Allyx O'Connor 12:03:27 pm
	
		ok, doing that now. It might be a minute before they respond
	
		I sent a seperate email to both of them to let them know to look for it, so far fort george specifically hasn't received it. Haven't heard from clatsop
	

	Anton 12:18:06 pm
	
		Let me check in with my team to see if there is anything else we can try, can i reach you at allyx@adrifthospitality.com ?
	

	Allyx O'Connor 12:18:12 pm
	
		you can, thank you
	
		Just an update, one of the email addresses attached to clatsop received the email. The other hasn't.
	

	Anton 12:30:30 pm
	
		Was it the Office Admin email that didn't go through?
	

	Allyx O'Connor 12:30:34 pm
	
		correct
	

	Anton 12:46:52 pm
	
		So if you are receiving the order via email but the vendor is not, can you check with the vendor if they have additional emails to use or to include a phone number and receive it by  text message.
	

	Allyx O'Connor 12:47:52 pm
	
		These would be the only emails and neither has been willing to take orders by text.
	

	Anton 12:50:39 pm
	
		Then it appears the issue is with the vendor email as bevspot can still send the order to you.
	

	Allyx O'Connor 12:51:00 pm
	
		so no suggestions on that?
	

	Anton 12:59:05 pm
	
		You will have to speak to the vendor and see if there is something on their end, if you can still receive the order on your personal email, then the issue is with their point of contact.

		I would like to cancel my account.  How do I go about doing that?  I see that a payment just went through yesterday for the month.  Since it is just one day after can I please get a refund and cancel?
	

	Anton 12:07:26 pm

		If I could ask, why would you like to cancel the account?
	

	Jana Lucas 12:24:46 pm
	
		its more of a hassle in the long run.  My accounts that I order from have to manually enter in what Im ordering and almost every time, they miss items.  They keep saying that wouldn't happen if i order directly from them so to stop the mistakes, I've just got to order through them.  Bevspot was convenient but too many mistakes

	Lahni Stellmacker  11:12:10 am
	
		Hello I was just looking at my sales report and its not telling me my profitability. Everything just comes up as zero.
	

	Kendra 11:12:30 am
	
		Hello Lahni, let me take a look at that for you 
	
		Are you in a food or beverage account? What are the date ranges?
	

	Lahni Stellmacker  11:26:53 am
	
		We have both. Dat ranges are April 1 to 19
	

	Kendra 11:29:50 am
	
		Are you familiar with mapping items? 
	

	Lahni Stellmacker  11:30:22 am
	
		No. What is that?
	

	Kendra 11:31:14 am
	
		Mapping items is linking the information in BevSpot to the information being pulled from the POS .
	

	Lahni Stellmacker  11:31:32 am
	
		How do I do that?
	

	Kendra 11:35:08 am
	
		We are happy to explain over the phone, which is easier. Is there a good time to contact you to go over this? 
	
		What is a good number to reach you at/
	

	Lahni Stellmacker  11:38:43 am
	
		How about 3pm my number is 780 223 9355
	

	Kendra 11:39:42 am
	
		3pm EST
	

	Lahni Stellmacker  11:47:20 am
	
		Mountain time
	

	Kendra 11:48:33 am
	
		Currently I have a colleague who is available 3pm EST, I have to check to see if anyone is available at 3pm mountain time

		hi kendra
	
		i need help with 2 things
	

	Kendra 01:32:34 pm
	
		Hi Nicholas, how can I help
	

	Nicholas Senneca 01:32:43 pm
	
		okay first thing which will be easier
	
		my Espresso Martini every week is not pulling automatically
	
		i feel that it is mapped wrong or idk maybe you can help me
	

	Kendra 01:42:27 pm
	
		https://cdn.livechat-static.com/api/file/lc/att/7006471/5a68301bef816174946b83969ab28499/Screen%20Shot%202021-04-19%20at%201.41.26%20PM.png
	
		Its mapped by ingredients, therefore it is connected with Tito's amongst other ingredients. Please see attached.
	

	Nicholas Senneca 01:42:50 pm
	
		i honestly just mapped it
	
		but every week i have to re add it
	
		same thing with my Sangria the normal one
	
		which i had to manually map today too
	

	Kendra 01:44:53 pm
	
		I am honestly not sure why it is not mapping automatically. I will talk with my team and get a better understanding as to why this is happening. 
	

	Nicholas Senneca 01:45:08 pm
	
		okay thos et wo items
	
		those two*
	
		i have one more questions now too
	

	Kendra 01:45:37 pm
	
		Okay shoot
	

	Nicholas Senneca 01:45:47 pm
	
		under my beer tab
	
		i have ""Model Especial Bottles""
	
		there is another thing called Modelo Especial which is pulling the bottles i am selling and not from the model especial bottle one
	
		says 150 is sold and then says im short 180 so i know where its coming from just cant figure out how to switch it over.
	

	Kendra 01:53:05 pm
	
		If you refresh the page, it was mapped to the wrong item and we adjusted that. You should see the numbers are reflected accordingly.

		Each week when i complete the count I have to edit the date.
	

	Kendra 01:12:18 pm
	
		Hello bruce, let me take a look at that for you 
	
		Hello Bruce, I have been looking at your account and not sure why it would not be populating correctly. I am going to figure this out and I will email you when it is solved. Is the brucehowe65@gmail.com the best email to contact you at?
	
		BevSpot will default you finalization date to the date you click, ""start count"", within BevSpot.
	
		If you start the count on a date other than the date you wish to serve as your finalization date, you will need to go in and edit the count info to reflect the appropriate date.

		Hi from BevSpot Support! Check out our help center at www.bevspot.com/help or chat us here if you have any questions as you move around the software.
	

	Mark LaGrange 01:33:03 pm
	
		where can i find the item sales performance chart?
	

	Laura 01:34:02 pm
	
		Hi Mark, are you looking for the Sales Profitability report that lists all your sales items?
	
		https://app.bevspot.com/group/dashboard/g/killingme/
	
		Is it this one? (scroll to the bottom)
	

	Mark LaGrange 01:35:14 pm
	
		there was a chart and i just saw it in a video that i forgot about.  it showed dots for each item on a graph by sales amount and profitablitily
	
		it was a chart
	

	Laura 01:35:57 pm
	
		Yes, scroll down to see the chart
	
		(and I'd look at one restaurant at time to make things clearer)
	
		https://cdn.livechat-static.com/api/file/lc/att/7006471/cd7133f42d1d9af89da25ab09092373c/Screen%20Shot%202021-04-28%20at%201.36.18%20PM.png
	
		This is what I see on this page when I look at just the Elliotts Beverage account
	

	Mark LaGrange 01:36:49 pm
	
		on the dashboard?
	

	Laura 01:37:32 pm
	
		yes, on the Killing Me! dashboard, scroll down past the summary of each account and past the line graph, and you'll see the scatterplot at the very bottom
	
		that was a screenshot from this page
	

	Mark LaGrange 01:38:18 pm
	
		i get inventory/cart/account activity
	
		no scatterplot
	

	Laura 01:40:20 pm
	
		ok, it looks like the email of yours with access to the full Killing Me account is this one: manager@elliottsonlinden.com

	
		Do i have the wrong Mark
	

	Mark LaGrange 01:40:52 pm
	
		edisons pub
	

	Laura 01:40:52 pm
	
		Yes, I think I do. Sorry for the confusion!
	
		Ok, let's try that again!
	
		edisons and canoe, right?
	

	Mark LaGrange 01:41:19 pm
	
		yes
	

	Laura 01:42:25 pm
	
		Give me just a minute
	
		it looks like we haven't set you up with a group account. I can do that for you now. Does your restaurant group have a name?
	

	Mark LaGrange 01:44:08 pm
	
		I sold the canoe club so leave them seperate
	

	Laura 01:45:48 pm
	
		Hmm, I think currently there are just two ways to see the scatterplot - group account or revert to the old sales variance report. Let me transfer you to someone who can be of more assistance. One sec!
	

	System 01:46:04 pm
	
		You were transferred to Kendra
	

	Mark LaGrange 01:46:43 pm
	
		what happened to my sales item performacne scatterplot?
	
		for edisons pub
	

	Kendra 01:50:01 pm
	
		Hi Mark, let me just take a look at this real quick and get myself caught up on the issue.
	
		For clarification, you can't see the scatterplot on the dashboard correct?
	

	Mark LaGrange 01:52:44 pm
	
		no
	

	Kendra 01:56:41 pm
	
		Can you do me a favor and refresh the page and let me know if it is there now?
	

	Mark LaGrange 01:58:09 pm
	
		no
	

	Kendra 02:13:49 pm
	
		You see a chart but its not the scatterplot you want correct?
	

	Mark LaGrange 02:14:54 pm
	
		i want to see the sales item performance chart that i had.  laura called it a scatterplot
	

	Kendra 02:15:39 pm
	
		https://app.bevspot.com/sales/reports/item_level/summary/60857bb4acc0dc6c86fe5196/r/edisonspubbe/
	
		If you go to your Sales, history tab it should be there for April 25
	
		Im sorry for the dates of April 14-22

	Mark LaGrange 02:21:51 pm
	
		and now its there?
	

	Kendra 02:22:30 pm
	
		Yes we turned you back to old sales variance report like Laura mentioned
	
		Do you see it on your end?
	

	Mark LaGrange 02:23:40 pm
	
		what was the new version for?
	

	Kendra 02:25:27 pm
	
		the new version is set up for you to be able to see your reports right after completing inventory
	

	Mark LaGrange 02:28:08 pm
	
		how long do i have to wait for a report now that we are going backwards?
	

	Kendra 02:28:29 pm
	
		Usually 24 hours 
	

	Mark LaGrange 02:28:53 pm
	
		why?
	
		no one explained any of this to me.  all i wanted was to see a report i was getting for several years
	

	System 02:34:34 pm
	
		You were transferred to Marguerite
	

	Marguerite 02:35:13 pm
	
		Hi Mark! 
	
		You have been on our new sales reporting feature for quite some time now. I recommend we leave you there because 1) you won't have to wait at least 24 hours to get your sales report and 2) you'll be able to easily go into the sales report and make any changes to it you would like (ie. mapping new menu items and accounting for comps/price reductions. 
	
		That's really the main difference from the old way, however, you will not get that scatterplot within the new version.

		BevSpot Support here! How can we help?
	

	Mark Martinez 01:50:20 pm
	
		I just connected our light speed account with bevspot and wanted to make sure we are good to go. Also I wanted to make sure our account is setup correctly, according to light speed, your service is free through them.
	

	Victoria 01:51:00 pm
	
		Hi Mark - Thank you for chatting in! 
	
		Hang tight for one moment while I take a look into your account
	
		This is for Paradice Oceanside Cafe correct?
	

	Mark Martinez 01:52:08 pm
	
		yes, it looks like we have two accounts. I am not sure how it works, is one for drinks and one for food?
	

	Victoria 01:52:37 pm
	
		Yes that is correct
	
		Your lightspeed integration is connected to both your food and beverage account correctly. 
	
		When you refer to free service, are you talking about being able to use the BevSpot account?
	

	Mark Martinez 01:56:30 pm
	
		Yes
	

	Victoria 01:57:41 pm
	
		Yes, everything you currently see within your BevSpot account is free for you to use. 
	

	Mark Martinez 01:59:45 pm
	
		Ok, so we do not have to worry about any type of billing currently for using BevSpot services. When does the service require a payment and for how long is the service free?
	

	Victoria 02:05:34 pm
	
		Taking a look into your account you currently do not have a subscription plan with us. Fortunate for you, you do have a plan with lightspeed and that is why you receive this free service of BevSpot. It does not have an end date but if you wanted to add more features to your BevSpot account, that's when pricing would become a factor. 
	
		BevSpot can provide you with a few different package plans if you were looking to advance from the standard plan you currently receive for free through lightspeed.
	

	Mark Martinez 02:07:20 pm
	
		We will first start with this level of service and expand as we go. Thank you
	

	Victoria 02:07:51 pm
	
		Sure thing! I'm happy to help! 
	
		Is there anything else I can help you with today? 
	

	Mark Martinez 02:14:28 pm
	
		No thank you, Have a great day.

		Keep getting a bunch of items popping up in mapping status  called name. with no sales attached and no POS item number. Can't figure out what it is?
	

	Victoria 10:46:06 am
	
		Hi Nicholas - Thanks for chatting in. Is this for your food or beverage account? 
	

	Nicholas Tone 10:46:23 am
	
		Beverage
	

	Victoria 10:46:40 am
	
		Ok, hang tight for one moment while I take a look 
	
		After taking a look into your account it seems like those items are coming from your POS system. I am not exactly sure why they are showing up in your account that way but it looks like the issue is stemming from your POSitouch. 
	

	Nicholas Tone 11:03:52 am
	
		Ever seen this before?
	

	Victoria 11:04:27 am
	
		I have not seen this issue before but I am going to reach out to one of my colleagues to see if he has ever experienced this with any of his accounts, hang tight for one moment

		Thank you
	

	Victoria 11:13:47 am
	
		Most definitely! I am currently waiting for a response from my team. Would you like me to send an email to allkings1@aol.com once I receive an update?

		With regards to the expected inventory count....how often does that refresh, or how can you force a refresh if available?
	

	Victoria 11:20:30 am
	
		Hi Brandon, thanks for chatting in! 
	
		In regard to expected inventory, you can select the starting inventory date on the top right-hand side next to the blue box "" Run Report"" Once you do that and click on "" Run Report"" you will see a list of all your items and the estimated amount you should have on hand based on your starting count, deliveries, and sales. 

	

	Brandon Evans 11:22:44 am
	
		I did....tried a sample sale, but it's not showing up 25 minutes later.
	

	Victoria 11:26:27 am
	
		Ok, hang tight for one moment while I take a look into this - Is this going to be for the food or beverage account?

		When printing an order (Invoice)....is there a simple way to print the merchandise received along with the photo of the invoice?  I see where we can export to excel, but that requires constant manipulation to fit onto a single page.  Is there a better way?

		Being a municipality, we have to attached an inventory receipt along with the invoice to process payments.
	

	Anton 03:42:44 pm
	
		Do you just want a copy of the picture of the invoice you submitted or are you talking about exporting all of the information from the order itself?
	

	Brandon Evans 03:43:54 pm
	
		Photo isn't as important.  When we export to excel, the info is good...it's just not formatted to fit on a single page.  Is there a better report to run where you don't have to reformat every time we check something in?
	

	Anton 03:47:33 pm
	
		That is the only way to export that data from Bevspot.

	Peter Mon, 05/03/21 10:43:34 am America/Chicago
	
		BevSpot Support here! How can we help?
	

	Christy Hackinson 10:46:33 am
	
		okay.  I'm back.  Would you look at Barone Fini under White Wine?
	

	Peter 10:47:22 am
	
		Sure thing, What might be the problem?
	

	Christy Hackinson 10:47:48 am
	
		That's one of the wines that is adding to cart as bottles instead of a case
	

	Peter 10:48:23 am
	
		Okay, one moment. Let me take a look
	
		Okay, so I see the 5 bottles of Barone in the cart. After Clicking into the item information i noticed you have set a par limit on that item of 6 bottles.  Based on your last inventory you have 1.8 bottles of Barone in sitting inventory currently. Those 5 bottles in the cart would bring that sitting inventory to just over your par. If you'd like to order more you can add more bottles manually in the cart or Remove the par and re-run Smart cart.  
	

	Christy Hackinson 10:55:18 am
	
		Some wines will order the case like Josh Cabernet though..
	
		Is that based on my on hand?
	

	Peter 10:58:05 am
	
		The Josh has a par limit set to 14. Any Pars you have set will make it so smart cart cant order more than that amount. I believe the Barone was set to 6, so thats why its auto filling your order with so little.
	

	Christy Hackinson 10:58:58 am
	
		ok
	

	Peter 10:58:59 am
	
		If you go back to the items page and click on the Barone, It will bring up a details page on the right hand side. You'll see Pars / bottle just under vendors.
	

	Christy Hackinson 10:59:46 am
	
		Yes, I understand that.  There isn't a way to make  it order by the case as default?
	

	Peter 11:01:51 am
	
		For that I would set your par limit on that item to the same number of bottles in a case, Potentially even  14 if the case if 12 because BevSpot will take into account whats on hand.
	
		Ideally, the smart cart it used to help reduce sitting inventory so its always going to suggest what to order based on your usage. 
	

	Christy Hackinson 11:03:45 am
	
		ok.  Thank you.

		good morning
	

	Kendra 11:56:05 am
	
		hello Thomas
	

	Thomas Casabona 11:56:29 am
	
		i cant get the inventory in my cart to reflect the changes I made to the actual inventory
	

	Kendra 11:57:10 am
	
		This is for the Mesita Beverage account correct
	

	Thomas Casabona 11:57:31 am
	
		no  the ainsworth dry goods
	

	Kendra 11:57:46 am
	
		Thank you for that. Let me take a look at that for you 
	

	Thomas Casabona 11:58:12 am
	
		great.  inventory for sat april 24th to mon may 3 21
	
		are you still there?
	

	Kendra 12:04:00 pm
	
		yes just taking a look at to why this would be happening 
	

	Thomas Casabona 12:09:03 pm
	
		ok  thank you
	

	Kendra 12:13:43 pm
	
		what items have you made changes to in the inventory and what are you seeing in the cart?
	

	Thomas Casabona 12:14:19 pm
	
		almost all of them.  in the cart builder under pepsi brisk lemon iced tea, the inventory says .8
	
		the cart builder it comes up as 1.8
	

	Kendra 12:15:58 pm
	
		If you search for pepsi brisk lemon iced tea you will see that it says .8 however it will be 1.8 because you might have that product in another storage area. Which means it is reflecting correctly 
	

	Thomas Casabona 12:16:25 pm

		Hi Sheldon! 
	
		In order to Unarchive an item, you will need to go into your items section then under the "" View By"" section select ""Archived items"" Once you do that, you can unarchive the item you would like to restore and all its historical data will appear.

		Are you using the old version of chrome by any chance?

		No I?m just taking a photo from my iPhone

		I just talked to the engineer team and they noted that there was a security bug in the latest IOS release last week. If you are able to update your version on your phone it should work for you.

		Hi Vincent - thanks for chatting in! 
	
		What can we help you with? 
	

	Vincent Sanchez 02:14:22 pm
	
		Hey sorry for the delay, i was wondering if you can check if i added any items on invoice # 43264
	

	Victoria 02:14:39 pm
	
		Is this going to be for the food or beverage account? 
	

	Vincent Sanchez 02:14:48 pm
	
		beverage
	
		also invoice # 49062
	

	Victoria 02:15:10 pm
	
		Alright, hang tight for one moment while I take a look into this for you. 
	

	Vincent Sanchez 02:15:16 pm
	
		thank you
	

	Victoria 02:21:18 pm
	
		In regard to invoice 43264, 5 items were added and marked delivered. 
	
		https://cdn.livechat-static.com/api/file/lc/att/7006471/84e39a615a0187f71098ed6003eae614/Screen%20Shot%202021-05-12%20at%202.20.33%20PM.png

	Vincent Sanchez 02:22:30 pm
	
		okay, how do i reopen the inventory and add the following items to hit in that inventory
	

	Victoria 02:27:11 pm
	
		I was just taking a look into your inventory history section for the count of March 27th to May 2nd the items you marked delivered from invoice 43264 are already accounted for in your inventory section. 
	
		Are you looking to add items to the invoice with nothing currently added? 
	

	Vincent Sanchez 02:28:38 pm
	
		I wanted to add items from invoice 49062, due to all the red marks i have on my inventory
	

	Victoria 02:29:52 pm
	
		Ok yes, so in that case, we will want to add the items into the order history section of your account.  
	
		Once you get to the order history page, you will want to scroll down to order that matches with the invoice 
	
		from here we can add the items from that invoice to the order within bevspot 
	
		Also we will want to keep the dates the same so they can fit in the timeline of that inventory count 
	

	Vincent Sanchez 02:32:11 pm
	
		Okay Perfect will it adjust my inventory balance? Do i have to reopen my inventory, Adjust date then close it out?
	

	Victoria 02:34:34 pm
	
		It should adjust the balance of the inventory, due to the fact that we kept this order within the time frame of the inventory count. I don't think you will need to make any adjustments to your inventory section. Hang tight for one moment. I'm just going to verify this with one of my colleagues to be certain. 
	

	Vincent Sanchez 02:34:58 pm
	
		okay thank you
	

	Victoria 02:46:02 pm
	
		After speaking with my colleague he informed me that you will need to go back into your inventory section to count the items you are adding into invoice #49062. Moving forward, If you have the time to enter those items on the invoice rather than just the invoice total, you wont have to worry about this ?
	
		If you've already counted these items in your inventory, adding them to this invoice should remedy your negative usage
	

	Vincent Sanchez 02:47:57 pm
	
		But i already counted the items thats why i am negative. Yes usually i enter them once i receive them and not before i start counting my inventory
	
		okay perfect, so reopen inventory and put in the items from the invoice. Close out inventory and it should be correct
	

	Victoria 02:50:26 pm
	
		Simply add the line items onto the invoice within the order history section, save the invoice, then look at the inventory to confirm that everything lines up?
	

	Vincent Sanchez 02:50:58 pm
	
		okay perfect

		Hi there
	
		 We are looking to start the kitchen inventory too. I was wondering if you have a combined price for both food & beverage? Our beverage inventory is still done on spreadsheets since you are not able to properly match the Toast POS download. We are using their price by size option and that does not seem to work in BevSpot

		missing a column to upload items
	

	Annie 08:32:50 pm
	
		Hi Lesli! Let me see what I can find out for you from my end!
	

	Lesli Schneider 08:33:17 pm
	
		looking to assign columns, it's different from the export
	

	Annie 08:34:38 pm
	
		Did you try to import an excel doc to upload items? 
	
		Sorry just a little confused on what you mean by assigning columns
	

	Lesli Schneider 08:34:59 pm
	
		I exported an item excel, edited it and am trying to re-upload
	

	Annie 08:35:53 pm
	
		So are you having issues with your items not matching up in your ""vendor, item name, category, etc."" columns?
	

	Lesli Schneider 08:36:18 pm
	
		there is no matching category for container type
	
		https://cdn.livechat-static.com/api/file/lc/att/7006471/9c17d2c41c1f731c3466a7ad9582a2fd/Screen%20Shot%202021-05-14%20at%208.36.21%20PM.png
	

	Annie 08:40:09 pm
	
		I see! Unfortunately I do not believe that there is a column for packaging type while importing new items. However that can be specified in the individual items' page. As long as you have a unit size your items should import properly!
	

	Lesli Schneider 08:40:50 pm
	
		ok, just to be clear though I edited an excel I downloaded from bevspot
	

	Annie 08:42:35 pm
	
		Okay! On food accounts the packaging type can become a little more important, whereas on a beverage account the standard packaging is a bottle with the occasional can or keg.
	

	Lesli Schneider 08:42:55 pm
	
		ok as long as it doesn't impact the pricing
	
		my first upload all my prices were wonky
	

	Annie 08:43:34 pm
	
		Did you have some unit prices go under case prices or vice versa?
	

	Lesli Schneider 08:44:12 pm
	
		exactly
	
		I cleaned up this excel
	

	Annie 08:44:43 pm
	
		I'm happy to take a look at the whole doc for you if that would make you feel better about importing!
	

	Lesli Schneider 08:45:07 pm
	
		let's try uploading it
	

	Annie 08:45:16 pm
	
		Sure thing!
	

	Lesli Schneider 08:45:44 pm
	
		is there an easier way to update deposit #s than going through each item?
	
		also what's the best way to note that some items are ordered from one vendor but the sales rep is with another?
	
		I just uploaded, what does the orange corner flag mean?
	

	Annie 08:49:43 pm
	
		I will look into the deposit numbers for you!
	
		For your vendor question I would consider adding your rep to the vendor page that the item comes from. 
	
		That orange flag just means that there is a note on that item!
	

	Lesli Schneider 08:52:00 pm
	
		Is it possible to note where orders are sent within the vendor or item?
	
		so if there is a rep and an order desk under one vendor only the order desk gets an email?
	

	Annie 08:54:27 pm
	
		Under the vendors tab you can select as many email addresses as you'd like to receive your order. It looks like maybe not all your reps have been added to the specific vendors yet, but you'll see a box to select that someone receives your order via email or text.
	

	Lesli Schneider 08:57:52 pm
	
		ok, I'll take a look
	
		any thoughts on how to easily update the deposit?
	

	Annie 08:58:32 pm
	
		My initial thought was the bulk edit option, but are your deposits different for every single item?
	

	Lesli Schneider 09:03:38 pm
	
		it changes by category, but I don't see that column to edit on bulk edit?
	

	Annie 09:06:32 pm
	
		I can walk you through how to get there! On the left hand side of your items page you have filters.  If you select group by category, and then on the right hand side of the page you should see collapse all. If you check a category the bulk edit options comes up towards the upper left of the page. I'm sorry I just looked, and don't see an option for those deposits. You can however edit packaging from this page (bottles, cans, etc.).
	
		I'm sorry for my lack of info on an easier way to do the deposits. I can ask the team, and have someone reach out to you via email on Monday if there is an easier solution!
	

	Lesli Schneider 09:07:38 pm
	
		I'm actually working with the onboarding team, I can bug them
	
		thanks though
	

	Annie 09:09:16 pm
	
		Absolutely! Is there anything else I can help you with?
	

	Lesli Schneider 09:10:14 pm
	
		no, I think that's all for now
	
		Thank You!
	

	Annie 09:10:31 pm
	
		Happy I could help! Have a great weekend!

		Hi, I'm trying to see out current total inventory counts. I was told to look at the expected inventory page, but it's only showing amts from one of the inventories.
	

	Annie 07:28:47 pm
	
		Hi, I will look at that for you, and see if anything looks different from our end! Your expected inventory only uses one count, which is why it's showing up like that.
	

	Info beerbistro 07:29:09 pm
	
		oh - so where can I see what our total inventory amounts should be?
	
		we accidentally did two different counts today and I was told we can't merge them
	

	Annie 07:30:35 pm
	
		Were the counts totals from two different storage areas?
	
		Yes, unfortunately they can't be merged.
	

	Info beerbistro 07:30:59 pm
	
		yes - hit final count too soon
	

	Annie 07:33:25 pm
	
		Typically your expected inventory would reflect the initial count that you guys had done, but because there were two counts done it will only take from one. I am going to find out if there's any way to view those counts combined since they cannot be merged.
	

	Info beerbistro 07:33:37 pm
	
		thanks
	
		also I was trying to clean up our acct because we were testing a bunch of things before starting to use it properly
	
		I accidentally deleted the inventory I finished yesterday - is it possible to bring that back?
	

	Annie 07:36:06 pm
	
		I can reach out to our engineering team to see if it's possible to retrieve it. Typically once a count is deleted it can't be brought back.
	

	Info beerbistro 07:36:19 pm
	
		that's what I thought
	
		I will just manually enter the info from today

		You were transferred to Peter
	

	Peter 02:56:32 pm
	
		Hey Ben. So the next time you go to count inventory search the items in the order they appear on the shelves. After everything is counted, at the top of the  screen you will see 3 dots in a row. Open that drop down menu and select ""Arrange storage area as edited""
	
		After you've done this to lock it in press Re-Sort at the bottom of the screen.
	
		if you'd like to just move an individual item there is 8 small dots to the left of  the item within your storage area. As you hover over those dots your curser will turn into a hand. You can grab that item and rearrange it within your storage area.
	

	Ben Liles 02:59:45 pm

		BevSpot Support here! How can we help?
	

	Joseph Lewis 11:41:12 am
	
		Can Bev Spot be connected to two primary categories within Toast?  I.E. food&drink  second one being Merchandise
	
		I can't seem to link the items in merchandise.
	

	Peter 11:42:16 am
	
		Hey Joseph, Any item that has a POS ID within your Toast POS system can be linked to BevSpot.
	
		How do you have your merchandise Set up in your POS
	

	Joseph Lewis 11:44:18 am
	
		The toast Menus start with the two options listed above and then the drop down items under each of the primary categories.  FOOD & DRINK.    MERCHANDISE
	
		It just seems as if Bevspot is not seeing the Merchandise items.  Rather only the Food & Drink category.

	Peter 11:49:29 am
	
		Okay i see, For Bevspot to pull items from your POS system they need to be rung in like a purchase on your POS System. BevSpot will pull individual items  by the items POS ID as they are ordered through your POS System.  A good way to get everything into BevSpot is to make a mock order, One of everything and then void or comp that order once its through. 
	

	Joseph Lewis 11:51:45 am
	
		Ok, so when you search for an item to link from Bev Spot to Toast the item must have been rung up in Toast for BS to see it?
	

	Peter 11:52:14 am
	
		Yes!
	

	Joseph Lewis 11:52:28 am
	
		Ok, thanks.

		Hi Kendra,
	

	Kendra 04:43:05 pm
	
		Hi William 
	

	William Cloonan 04:43:34 pm
	
		Is it possible to initiate a voice call?  I am trying to work with my beverage director to better understand the software for inventory reporting.
	

	Kendra 04:45:04 pm
	
		Of course! I see that your Customer Service Manager is Nick, did you want me to schedule some time for you to chat with him?
	

	William Cloonan 04:45:47 pm
	
		Sure that would be great, I was hoping to resolve this today.  We need to submit an inventory report to ownership this afternoon.
	
		The issue that we're running into is that once an inventory is finalized it resets the count to zero.  Is there a way to generate a report from previous inventory periods?
	

	Kendra 04:48:09 pm
	
		Okay let me take a quick look
	

	William Cloonan 04:48:22 pm
	
		Thank you
	

	Kendra 04:50:00 pm
	
		Just want to make sure I am understanding your question correctly, so you want to use the same count as your previously finalized inventory?

		BevSpot Support here! How can we help?
	

	Ron Mims 11:13:47 am
	
		I am missing sales data from my Toast integration
	

	Victoria 11:14:25 am
	
		Hi Ron, Thanks for chatting! 
	
		hang tight for one moment while I take a look into this for you, what particular info are you missing? 
	

	Ron Mims 11:16:49 am
	
		The one that sticks out is from the sales 05/10 - 05/16 it is missing the sales item BTL D'Usse
	

	Victoria 11:17:18 am
	
		Alright - Let me take a look into this
	
		Hi Ron - After taking a look into the most recent sales report I do see an item sale for BTL D'Usse VSOP and it shows 4 sold. I took a look into the items page and I don't see any items related to BTL D'Usse. 
	

	Ron Mims 11:30:09 am
	
		correct, that is the problem
	
		I have a recipe for BTL D'Usse
	
		https://cdn.livechat-static.com/api/file/lc/att/7006471/f86e9fb440677029bd6f087567e35e7f/dusse.JPG
	

	Victoria 11:35:43 am
	
		In order to track this, we will want to create it as an item within the items page
	

	Ron Mims 11:37:12 am
	
		None of my bottles are items, they are all recipes.  Look at all of my recipes that start with BTL
	

	Victoria 11:46:01 am
	
		Every single time that someone orders BTL D'Usse on your POS, it's pulling the D'Usse VSOP 750ML item from BevSpot. The way we know that is if you look to the right of the recipe name it gives you all the items within that one recipe. 
	

	Ron Mims 11:49:00 am
	
		Correct
	
		But for some reason it is not working as expected
	
		I think I may have figured out the issue
	

	Victoria 11:53:56 am
	
		https://cdn.livechat-static.com/api/file/lc/att/7006471/369929e0bccae00c8e79b1ffc83fd409/Screen%20Shot%202021-05-19%20at%2011.53.25%20AM.png
	

	Ron Mims 11:54:46 am
	
		Ok, that is better
	

	Victoria 11:55:20 am
	
		It is in your variance but instead of sorting it by your menu items, variance is sorted by your items in BevSpot. However, you still are able to see the three bottles you sold if you hover hover over the "" sold"" tab 
	

	Ron Mims 11:56:18 am
	
		Ok, for some reason, it is now showing up.  Thanks if you did something, lol
	

	Victoria 11:58:47 am
	
		I'm happy to help! Have a great rest of your day! 
	

	Ron Mims 11:59:24 am
	
		Thanks you too

	Victoria 02:14:52 pm
	
		Hi Ross - I was able to take a look into your account but I am still trying to figure out what is causing the Blood O marg to not show up. 
	
		I noticed that in your account there was one-point, two different recipes for blood o marg. one of them having that El Camino Blanco tequila in it and the other one did not. I'm currently looking to find out if maybe the other recipe was mapped causing the tequila to not show up
	

	Ross Molineaux 02:17:58 pm
	
		should be with the El Camino blanco
	
		I think i deleted the other recipe
	

	Victoria 02:20:58 pm

	Luis Santiago 12:49:15 pm
	
		Hi, I am having a real big issue with my Corazon blanco.
	
		I think it was because when we switched from lunazul to Corazon, I accidentally hit all reports instead of future reports
	

	Marguerite 12:50:31 pm
	
		Got ya! 
	

	Luis Santiago 12:50:45 pm
	
		I think it's having a trickle effect
	

	Marguerite 12:50:53 pm
	
		Interesting, what makes you think that? 
	

	Luis Santiago 12:52:36 pm
	
		Because from the 16 downward until the 1st of November, it shows that Im up a lot of Corazon blanco and down a tone of lunazul blanco
	
		and then after that, even though I input correct prep and what not I've been down blanco
	

	Marguerite 12:55:34 pm
	
		Okay, so would it help if we switched it back?
	

	Luis Santiago 12:56:21 pm
	
		no because we no longer have it
	
		i don't know, it's the only way it makes sense in my head because I know im not down 56 bottles of corazon blanco, its impossible
	

	Marguerite 12:58:25 pm
	
		Hmmm... I see! 
	
		Let's talk with Brian, maybe he can figure out the best way forward!
	

	Luis Santiago 12:58:54 pm
	
		Brian as in Albe
	
		like my boss?
	

	Marguerite 01:00:53 pm
	
		Nope! Brian as in Henise, your account manager. 
	

	Luis Santiago 01:01:08 pm
	
		oh that'd be great
	

	Marguerite 01:01:14 pm
	
		Perfect!
	
		Checking his schedule now... one sec!
	
		How does 12:30 ET tomorrow work for you? 
	

	Luis Santiago 01:02:27 pm
	
		thats fine
	
		by the way, is the net on the pmix the base servings sold plus the serving adjustments?
	

	Marguerite 01:04:42 pm
	
		I do not know that information. I'll let Brian know that's one of your questions as well. 
	
		Sorry, Luis!
	

	Luis Santiago 01:06:16 pm

		Hi,  I am trying to update the pack size on Grand Marnier from $468/12pk to $234/6pack but it keeps giving me and error.  I would prefer not to create a whole new item if possible
	

	Kendra 12:21:10 pm
	
		Hello Maurice! I will take a quick look at that for you! Its for El Camino Beverage correct?
	

	Maurice Roisman 12:21:20 pm
	
		Yes
	

	Kendra 12:25:01 pm
	
		Im going to take a look at that right now for you!
	
		Question for you about this item, have you ever transferred this item from this location to another?
	

	Maurice Roisman 12:29:25 pm
	
		Probably but I am not sure
	

	Kendra 12:29:58 pm
	
		It looks like it is showing $234.00 for the six pack. Please let us know if you can see that on your end.
	

	Maurice Roisman 12:31:27 pm
	
		I just refreshed the page and it still shows $468/12pk
	
		I can log out and log back in and see if that updates it for me
	

	Kendra 12:32:15 pm
	
		It is for the Cordon Rouge Grand Marnier correct?
	

	Maurice Roisman 12:32:44 pm
	
		Grand Marnier 1 Liter, Cordon Rouge

		This is what it shows on my end. Do you see something different?
	

	Maurice Roisman 12:35:25 pm
	
		You are in Fort Lauderdale.  I am in Delray
	

	Kendra 12:35:39 pm
	
		I am so sorry, let me get to that account.
	

	Maurice Roisman 12:35:54 pm
	
		No worries, easy mistake.

		It looks like I am also getting that ""error message."" If this item was transferred unfortunately you can not make the changes without making a new item. 
	

	Maurice Roisman 12:41:57 pm
	
		alright, thanks for looking in to it.
	

	Kendra 12:42:12 pm

		BevSpot Support here! How can we help?
	

	Matheus De Araujo 10:34:59 am
	
		Good morning, I'm having issues with the invoices coming from plateiq to Bevspot on the Harvard account. how do I fix it?
	

	Rob 10:35:44 am
	
		Hi Matheus.  Can you explain a bit more what you mean - is it something that is working with your other location?
	

	Matheus De Araujo 10:39:25 am
	
		we use plateiq at our corporate office. once they approve the invoices on their end the invoices will show up on our Bevspot on each location. we set up the new account for the harvart location back in October and we haven't got any invoices. first we thought it was because the option was block by your system, someone there turn on the option and we haven't seen any invoices.
	

	Rob 10:40:54 am
	
		Gotcha!  So the Harvard location is the only one in which this doesn't seem to showing the invoices correctly?
	

	Matheus De Araujo 10:41:05 am
	
		correct.
	

	Rob 10:41:08 am
	
		Matheus, could you share your plateIQ restaurant id for that location?
	

	Matheus De Araujo 10:41:39 am
	
		I will have to get the office to send it to you. what is your Email info?
	

	Rob 10:41:51 am
	
		that would be great - you can email that to support@bevspot.com 
	
		That way our support team will have eyes on this and can better help!
	

	Matheus De Araujo 10:42:15 am
	
		ok let me get on it. thank you.
	

	Rob 10:42:27 am
	
		Of course.  In the mean time I will let them know to keep an eye out
	
		Once we have that ID it should be a quick fix

		BevSpot Support here! How can we help?
	

	Ron Mims 10:36:46 am
	
		I have a duplicate Item, what is the best way to consolidate
	

	Rob 10:37:06 am
	
		Hey Ron, happy to help.  What is the account/duplicate item so I can take a look
	

	Ron Mims 10:37:38 am
	
		Society Detroit
	

	Rob 10:38:26 am
	
		Taking a look now, what item in particular
	

	Ron Mims 10:38:48 am
	
		Casamigos Anejo
	
		iL
	
		1L
	

	Rob 10:39:47 am
	
		Cool, just loading things now
	
		which do you regularly order - it looks like 1 is a 6x1L, the other is at 12x1L with different btl cost
	

	Ron Mims 10:41:41 am
	
		6x
	

	Rob 10:42:38 am
	
		It looks like the most recent order was a 12/case.  What I would recommend is to reconcile within your oder history
	
		And I'm happy to chat through that, just have a few questions
	
		On the order from 3/25 with Nws MI it says you ordered 12 at a total cost 657.84 - is that accurate?
	

	Ron Mims 10:44:10 am
	
		yes, 2 cases of 6
	

	Rob 10:44:53 am
	
		gotcha!  Okay so what we'll want to do is record that as a backdated invoice and then delete this item that comes at a 12/case 
	

	Ron Mims 10:47:16 am
	
		ok
	

	Rob 10:48:12 am
	
		I can also keep an eye out on the sales reports to make sure thing are mapped accordingly.  I think perhaps archiving the item would actually be better than deleting completely
	

	Ron Mims 10:48:25 am
	
		ok
	
		Ok, I will try that out, gotta jump on a call, thanks for your help.  But just to be clear, there is no way to consolidate, would need to delete the duplicate
	

	Rob 10:53:57 am
	
		Correct, as they have different prices and packaging - though I will relay to the product team/see if I can find a better work around!  If you need anything else or want to follow up on this you can shoot me a note to rob@bevspot.com

		BevSpot Support here! How can we help?
	

	Ron Mims 01:33:13 pm
	
		For some reason the app says I sold 3 bottles of an item, but the pos data says 1
	
		normally not a big deal but this is a very expensive bottle and it is skewing the numbers
	

	Kendra 01:34:19 pm
	
		Thank you for that information, let me take a look at your account.
	

	Ron Mims 01:36:54 pm
	
		the item is Cristal
	

	Kendra 01:38:19 pm
	
		Just to confirm this is for Society Detroit: Beverage
	

	Ron Mims 01:38:43 pm
	
		Yes
	

	Kendra 01:47:01 pm
	
		https://cdn.livechat-static.com/api/file/lc/att/7006471/aa3aec88e028439590d512bbdda005f6/Screen%20Shot%202021-04-13%20at%201.45.23%20PM.png
	
		After taking a look into your account I noticed there was no second inventory taken on the Cristal. 
	

	Ron Mims 01:51:36 pm
	
		Are you saying we needed to put 0 as the inventory?
	

	Kendra 01:58:27 pm
	
		Correct. Did you count 0 for Cristal?
	

	Ron Mims 01:59:23 pm
	
		We never do that, if we don?t count an item, to us it is because we are out of that item
	

	Kendra 01:59:43 pm
	
		Looks like we have a positive variance on this item, which in BevSpot, it means we sold more of this than we had. Given that's impossible, might be a sign of negative usage within your account.
	
		Are we sure we recorded this item's deliveries this past week?
	

	Ron Mims 02:00:55 pm
	
		we have not had any deliveries for this item since last year.
	
		If you look at the POS data, it says base sold 3, this seems to be the problem
	

	Kendra 02:07:45 pm
	
		Thanks for your patience, we are looking into this for you. If you need to leave the chat we will make sure to follow up with an email. 
	

	Ron Mims 02:08:30 pm
	
		Ok
	

	Kendra 02:09:17 pm
	
		What is the pos_id for this Cristal should be?
	
		We currently have it has deb4cd72-615c-461b-bc3f-ee7f1a9be038
	

	Ron Mims 02:12:58 pm
	
		That is the same that I see
	

	Kendra 02:13:58 pm
	
		On your POS, are you sure you are taking your sales from the 5th-12th?
	

	Ron Mims 02:15:59 pm
	
		We use Toast, so it is an integration, we don?t manually load the sales
	

	Kendra 02:18:47 pm
	
		Okay - How do you know you only sold 1 bottle of this Cristal?
	
		Because BevSpot pulls your sales from Toast and your sales say you've sold 3 bottles. How do you know that is not correct?
	

	Ron Mims 02:19:36 pm
	
		In Toast, it only has the 1 sold
	
		https://cdn.livechat-static.com/api/file/lc/att/7006471/cc1e6d3899e679afb74e4fef0befeac6/image.jpg
	

	Kendra 02:20:38 pm
	
		Okay! Ron, we're going to run a sales report manually to see if we can see the issue here. Would you mind sending over a product mix to our support team?
	

	Ron Mims 02:21:00 pm
	
		This is the pmix file
	
		i can, what email address?
	

	Kendra 02:21:38 pm
	
		support@bevspot.com
	
		Thank you for chatting in! We will run that for you once we receive the the product mix. 
	
		Appreciate the patience as we continue to fix the issue.
	

	Ron Mims 02:23:21 pm
	
		Is there a reference number or are they expecting the file?
	

	Kendra 02:25:18 pm
	
		Don't worry about it! They are expecting the file. Also, in the future you can  call our support phone at 617.658.3123 
	

	System 02:34:58 pm
	
		You rated our customer service as good

		BevSpot Support here! How can we help?
	

	Ron Mims 10:42:17 am
	
		For some reason my report process and results have changed, was there a new software release or something?
	

	System 10:42:37 am
	
		You were transferred to Kendra
	

	Kendra 10:44:41 am
	
		Hey Ron thanks for chatting in what report are you referring to?
	

	Ron Mims 10:45:26 am
	
		The sales report.  Last week, I was able to run the report and get the results in seconds because we are integrated with toast
	
		also the results no longer show the variances clearly, I have attached what it gave us a week ago
	
		https://cdn.livechat-static.com/api/file/lc/att/7006471/a845c5e2b7901f80b0d783bcab6266c5/variance.JPG
	

	Kendra 10:47:21 am
	
		Hang tight for one moment while I take a look into this for you
	
		Hey it looks like it is all set. If you want to refresh your page and let us know!
	

	Ron Mims 10:58:18 am
	
		Ok thanks!  much better
	

	Kendra 10:58:30 am
	
		Perfect! 
	

	Ron Mims 10:59:07 am
	
		now I can chase down this wild 28% variance ?
	
		While I have you on the line, can you help me with one of the products?  We have a don julio 1.75 bottle that we sold but it is not showing up as being sold
	
		the 1942 one
	
		never mind, I see the problem
	

	Kendra 11:08:48 am
	
		Alright perfect, I was taking a look for you but I am glad you found the issue
	

	Ron Mims 11:09:16 am
	
		They rang up a regular Don Julio 1.75 instead of 1942
	

	Kendra 11:09:52 am
	
		Glad you were able to figure it out! Can I help you with anything else?
	

	Ron Mims 11:10:03 am
	
		No I am all set
	

	Kendra 11:10:18 am
	
		Have a great rest of your day!

		Hi
	
		Can we get sales reports for Andiamo West and Andiamo Fenton
	

	Kendra 11:55:16 am
	
		Hello Blendi, I did just take a look at both accounts waiting for the sales report to run. Andiamo Warren is still waiting for finalized inventory. For Andiamo Fenton it says it has partial inventory completed and we can't run on a partial inventory. Did you want to change that to finalized inventory?
	

	Blendi Suvaria 11:56:13 am
	
		yes please
	

	Kendra 12:02:33 pm
	
		Our team will go into your account and fix that mistake so we can run the Fenton report for you! Moving forward I would just double check that inventory count section to make sure you don't see ""Partial"" checked off before finalizing the inventory
	
		For the Warren account it says you haven't started an inventory count. The last cycle was March 29 to April 5.

		The sales report has been run the report for Lil Empire Bridgeland - the only thing that needs to be done from here is mapping, Is this something you are familiar with? 
	

	Janeth Guzman 02:57:14 pm
	
		not at all ? sorry
	

	Victoria 02:58:21 pm
	
		No worries! Mapping is just connecting your POS sale items to the items within your bevspot account!
	
		What you will want to do is, click into the most recent sales report 
	
		go over to the tab at the top of the report that says "" POS DATA""

		We use Touch Bistro and its not integrated
	

	Victoria 03:01:06 pm
	
		Yes, that is correct. That's why we need to go in and manually link the two since it's not integrated. 
	

	Janeth Guzman 03:02:04 pm
	
		Ok
	
		Can you please guide me step by step so I can do the integration?

		Hi from BevSpot Support! Check out our help center at www.bevspot.com/help or chat us here if you have any questions as you move around the software.
	

	Anthony Selna 11:26:42 am
	
		How do I make an edit to the ""vendor"" name?
	

	Kendra 11:28:36 am
	
		Hi Anthony
	
		To make an edit to the vendors name you are going to go under the ""order"" tab
	
		Once there you will see the ""vendors"" tab. Click on the vendor you would like to change and you can make any edit needed there
	

	Anthony Selna 11:29:50 am
	
		Great. Thank you
	

	Kendra 11:29:59 am
	
		No problem! Have a great day!
	

	Anthony Selna 11:30:23 am
	
		I'm trying to merge 2 of them without moving out items. Will that still be possible?
	

	Kendra 11:32:52 am
	
		If you go to the item tabs and find the items that need to be moved over, all you have to do is click that item, and ordering information should pop up. You will see the vendor that is there already and can change it to the new vendor.
	
		You can even sort the items by vendors so its easier to change to the correct vendor
	

	Anthony Selna 11:35:06 am
	
		Cool. Thank you. That will be all.
	

	Kendra 11:35:21 am
	
		You're welcome! Have a great rest of your day

		Hey Kendra
	
		Can you check why i am showing no sales for Untitled Art ""Juicy IPA"" under drafts we sold 41
	
		I am looking at my variance report
	

	Kendra 12:21:25 pm
	
		Hi Ross
	
		Let me take a look real quick
	
		Which account is this for?
	

	Ross Molineaux 12:22:27 pm
	
		Park Tavern
	

	Kendra 12:22:43 pm
	
		Just wanted to make sure! Im going to take a look right now 
	
		Just want to make sure I am understanding, you sold 41 however, on the variance report it shows you sold 0?
	

	Ross Molineaux 12:33:44 pm
	
		yes
	
		So missing a .22
	

	Kendra 12:36:23 pm
	
		On our end it is showing you sold 41 however, it says its mapped at 10 fl oz instead of 16 fl oz. Let me see if changing it to 16 fl oz helps. Will you refresh your page and see if it fixed it on your end?
	

	Ross Molineaux 12:39:21 pm
	
		it should be 10oz
	
		it just showing no sales on my variance report
	
		If I knew how take screen shot i would show lol

		BevSpot Support here! How can we help?
	

	Dylan Evans 10:23:52 am
	
		i just have a quick question about bring in a new food item. it comes in a package but the lbs can be different each package what is the best way to bring that item in?
	

	Kendra 10:25:34 am
	
		Of course Dylan, so it's the same item but each time it will come in different size pacakges?
	

	Dylan Evans 10:26:08 am
	
		yeah i pick it up at a local butcher so its always the same product but some times i grab 8lb some times i grab 10.4 lb
	

	Kendra 10:37:00 am
	
		As long as the unit is lbs each time, when going into the order history section to record that item, you will then be able to make the adjustment to the correct lbs you bought that day. 
	
		As long as the unit stays the same, the amount is an easy fix.
	

	Dylan Evans 10:37:53 am
	
		so when im brining it in as long as i bring it in as lbs a 
 i can adjust every time.
	

	Kendra 10:38:22 am
	
		Yes, you can adjust the amount of lbs for that item you just can not change the unit measure. 
	

	Dylan Evans 10:39:02 am
	
		ok perfect so unit ""package"" unit size in lbs
	

	Kendra 10:39:26 am
	
		Correct, if that is how it comes then yes. 
	

	Dylan Evans 10:39:34 am
	
		great thank you
	

	Kendra 10:39:54 am
	
		You're welcome! Have great day!

		hi kendra
	

	Kendra 02:44:24 pm
	
		Hello Nicholas
	

	Nicholas Senneca 02:44:41 pm
	
		my bozal castillo is pulling from one items and going to another item and i dont see the one its supposed to go to
	
		if that makes sense
	

	Kendra 02:46:09 pm
	
		Is this for Ft. Lauderdale or delray?
	

	Nicholas Senneca 02:52:16 pm
	
		ftl
	
		The bozal castilla is pulling
	
		but the bozal castilla reserva is not
	
		its pulling to the wrong one
	

	Kendra 02:53:08 pm
	
		ok so you want it to pull from the reserva not the other one correct?
	

	Nicholas Senneca 02:53:17 pm
	
		yes
	

	Kendra 02:53:33 pm
	
		Alright let me take a look for you, hold on one second
	

	Nicholas Senneca 02:53:37 pm
	
		no worries
	
		also having the same issue with my bulleit bourbon
	
		idk why it shows two its weird
	

	Kendra 03:01:07 pm
	
		It looks like a mapping issue. I just want to clarify, on your side it shows you sold 3 of castilla but you really sold 3 castilla reserva.
	

	Nicholas Senneca 03:02:15 pm
	
		https://cdn.livechat-static.com/api/file/lc/att/7006471/ff8311c604affdb10a36a39d7775794d/Untitled.png
	
		yes
	
		i sold 3
	
		the bulleit bourbon one its not showing i have a starting inventory
	
		when you get to that one and its showing it on the other one
	
		if you can show me how to fix these so i dont have to bother you guys
	

	Kendra 03:05:50 pm
	
		Okay, so for the Castilla Reserva, can you refresh your page and let me know if it is fixed and let me know
	

	Nicholas Senneca 03:06:23 pm
	
		yes that one is fixed
	

	Kendra 03:08:41 pm
	
		Okay, so for that one it was in fact a mapping issue, which I believe to be the case with the bourbon as well. What I did was go into the ""POS data"" and searched the item. I then went ahead and clicked the green map button on the right hand side. Once in there I fixed the items name to the correct one and deleted the wrong one. Once that was done, I just refreshed my page.
	

	Nicholas Senneca 03:10:21 pm
	
		a little confusing
	
		so you just backspaced the name and typed the new one in
	

	Kendra 03:10:38 pm
	
		correct
	
		In regard to the bourbon, I took a look into your most recent inventory and it shows two of the same item. One with a price of zero and one with a price of 31.50. Is there a reason for that?

	Kendra 03:35:30 pm
	
		Okay for the Bourban, I went in an archived the one for $0.00, you are going to have to go into the finalized inventory and change the total count of the bourban so everything adds up correctly.

		hi again
	

	Kendra 10:09:24 am
	
		Hi Zeke 
	

	Zeke Rameriez 10:09:57 am
	
		this is actually nick i am on zekes account he left it open
	
		remember the bulleit bourbon issue from yesterday
	

	Kendra 10:10:15 am
	
		Hi Nick, and yes I do 
	

	Zeke Rameriez 10:10:26 am
	
		its still confusing me because the two items
	
		there is another button there showing it again
	

	Kendra 10:12:01 am
	
		Which tab are you looking at? I am currently in the items tab and its only showing one Bulleit bourbon so i want to be on the same page as you 
	
		Are you in the finalized inventory?
	

	Zeke Rameriez 10:12:47 am
	
		yes
	
		https://cdn.livechat-static.com/api/file/lc/att/7006471/c1c769af7d65c5fbb051c04f9425cda6/Untitled.png
	
		see attached
	
		the top one is the one showing my last week inventory but the bottom one showing that i recieved the item under that one
	
		i guess there was another item made and archived
	

	Kendra 10:18:58 am
	
		I went into your finalized inventory and looked at your count for the Bourbon and it looks like the archived bourbon has 23.3 bottles for the total count, however the bourbon not archived has no bottles in inventory. 
	
		https://cdn.livechat-static.com/api/file/lc/att/7006471/28f22c617db4e4a6f4b1d215e6f40f3c/Screen%20Shot%202021-05-25%20at%2010.17.29%20AM.png
	
		might have to zoom in a little since the archived one doesn't show that great
	

	Zeke Rameriez 10:20:12 am
	
		so i got it to the correct one now i need to figure out why its pulling from the wrong one
	
		if you look again i got it moved correctly
	
		it was albled as a ""bevspot item""
	
		labled
	

	Kendra 10:25:05 am
	
		It looks like it is a POS system issue. If you have two buttons for the Bourbon, you are going to want to get rid of the one that is labled $0.00. You will still have all the history from it however, it won't keep pulling the wrong data each week. 
	

	Zeke Rameriez 10:25:48 am
	
		i checkd my POS and i only have 1 button
	
		its so confusing lol
	
		i dont understand what happend this week everything seems super off
	

	Kendra 10:29:05 am
	
		Okay then all you need to do is delete the Bourbon priced at $0.00 after you condense all the information connected to that item. Once it is condensed to the $31.50 bottle, you are going to want to either archive it or delete so it doesn't happen again. 
	
		Did you change the prices on one of them?
	

	Zeke Rameriez 10:37:59 am
	
		yeah but i changed it back
	
		now its back to where it was
	

	Kendra 10:42:33 am
	
		Ok perfect, in order for your bullet bourbon to pull correctly, we will only be able to have one item in the account that represents the bullet bourbon. We will want to make sure it has a price attached and all and any deliveries are being recorded for this one specific item. Once we have made the adjustments to show that there is only one bullet bourbon with one price of 31.50. You will then be in the perfect position to have your variance reports pull the correct items from your BevSpot account. In order for it to pull correctly, we will want to make sure the pos ID is attached to the one specific bullet bourbon.

		BevSpot Support here! How can we help?
	

	Tony Velovski 08:07:55 am
	
		Hi -- I am trying to get info about our account and to try to start using bevspot for the first time since we purchased it last year just before the pandemic shut us down -- The two Andrew's on your team told me that because we never got to use it after paying the amount for the  annual  fee that they would work with us to allow that first year to commence now , but I haven't been able to log in because it says we missed a payment
	

	Kendra 08:09:26 am
	
		Hi Tony, I can schedule some time with Andrew for you today so you can get this issue taken care of and you can start using BevSpot again.
	

	Tony Velovski 08:09:48 am
	
		Great -- I would like to do that please
	

	Kendra 08:10:17 am
	
		He has open availability today at 11:30, 12:30, 1:45, and after 4. Does any of this work for you
	

	Tony Velovski 08:10:30 am
	
		My time or yours -- in
	
		Pacific ?
	
		This is a priority for me so I will make room in my schedule the sooner the better
	
		is the first available at 830 my time in just a few minutes
	

	Kendra 08:12:16 am
	
		No our time. Since it is a priority, I will put you in 11:30 our time but that is 8:30 your time. Is that ok
	

	Tony Velovski 08:12:32 am
	
		yes great !!
	
		4242302722

	Ron Mims 11:38:35 am
	
		Why is my smart cart adding items that I just received and have not used?
	

	Kendra 11:41:51 am
	
		Hi Ron, let me take a look
	

	Ron Mims 11:42:34 am
	
		Ok, a good example is Amarito Amaretto
	
		and Arrow Long Island
	

	Kendra 11:43:18 am
	
		for the Amarito Amaretto is it for the 1L or the 750?
	

	Ron Mims 11:43:29 am
	
		1L
	

	Kendra 11:45:58 am
	
		You have not used either of these in the past 4 weeks correct?
	

	Ron Mims 11:46:48 am
	
		We use the Long Isl frequently, but not much Amarito
	

	Kendra 11:53:05 am
	
		Gotcha - smart cart will be an average based on the usage of the last four weeks or how ever you have set it up within your account, if its been used /inventoried within the past month this would be one reason it would cause this to show up, but since your saying these items have just been delivered and have not been used, there could be something else that ill need to take a deeper look into. 
	

	Ron Mims 11:55:19 am
	
		My fear is that I want to give this to an assistant manager and they may not have bothered to look and double order.  That would be great if you can look into it further.
	
		So just to give you a timeline, we received delivery last week, wednesday and friday.  We took inventory yesterday and that is when we see the smart cart add the same items that were just delivered.

		Hey Janeth, Thank you! Apologize for the wait. After combing through your account it seems the duplicate recipes were created during the mapping process. Whenever you build a recipe for an item in the POS Data Mapping page it creates a recipe as well. This is most likely the reason there was a small handful of duplicates. The duplicates Recipes wont effect your COGS unless they're mapped. What I would suggest is deleting the duplicates and making sure the most accurate recipes are the ones mapped to your POS ID?s. Additionally to get rid of the red flags head to your most recent Sales Report under ?Sales History? then go to POS Data. Filter by ?Mapping Status? From here you can map any unmapped items or unfinished recipes. I hope this helps!

	Lesli Schneider 04:27:00 pm
	
		Hi, one of the items on my order last week is not registering the additional product
	
		the item is Tynt Meadow, the order is from Horizon
	

	Peter 04:27:59 pm
	
		Hey Lesli, Let me take a look!
	
		I see the Tynt Meadow in your most recent Order.  What do you mean by not registering? Is this a new item?
	
		I think i might see the issue, you currently have 2 Items created for Tynt Meadow. One of them is just named ""Tynt Meadow"" and the other is ""Tynt Meadow Ale""  The ""Tynt Meadows"" has been archived. However, This this is the one with all the packaging and pricing information attached. This is also the one associated with the order. The Other Item ""Tynt Meadows Ale"" Is currently Live but has no Packaging or pricing information. I believe someone might have simply accidentally archived the wrong item. If you Archive or delete the ""Tynt Meadow Ale"" and reactive ""Tynt Meadows"" this should solve the issue.
	

	Lesli Schneider 04:49:33 pm
	
		ok so that explains a few things because we're getting different info for some items that had multiple listing
	
		how do I find the archived items?
	

	Peter 04:51:02 pm
	
		Go to ""Items & Recipes"" > ""Items ""> Open your filters on the left hand side and select ""Archived"" 
	
		From there you can check off which items you plan to reactive and an Un-archive button will appear at the top of the screen
	

	Lesli Schneider 04:53:34 pm
	
		so how do I adjust the history to reflect the correct info?
	
		also is this why there's a big list of ""missing items"" when we do the inventory?
	

	Peter 04:58:13 pm
	
		Theoretically the item history should auto populate when you reactive the item. I'll look deeper into that. I'm also not sure what you mean by the ""Missing items"" List. When do this list appear typically? 
	

	Lesli Schneider 05:01:34 pm
	
		when we're doing inventory counts, there is a section at the bottom under PRO TIP
	

	Peter 05:04:51 pm
	
		The Pro Tip List  is just suggesting Items that you might want consider adding to that storage area.
	

	Lesli Schneider 05:05:28 pm
	
		ok that's what I though
	
		thought
	

	Peter 05:06:32 pm
	
		Sure thing! Is there anything else i could help you with?
	

	Lesli Schneider 05:06:56 pm
	
		not right now
	

	Peter 05:07:05 pm
	
		Awesome, Have a great day!

	Janeth Guzman 10:57:35 am
	
		Hello Peter,
	
		I am looking at the  recipes page and I was wondering why I have some recipes twice or three times with the red flags on the left hand side
	
		Will this be throwing the COGS off ? I am trying to figure out wether the recipes are not put in properly or what other issue could be throwing our COGS so high, if you have any suggestions for me would be greatly appreciate it
	

	Peter 11:00:15 am
	
		Hey Janeth, Let me take a look for you
	

	Janeth Guzman 11:02:25 am
	
		thank you !
	
		Sorry one more question, I see at the very end of the page  where the recipes are there is a REPORT SUMMARY what does that mean and why Is is there?
	

	Peter 11:08:18 am
	
		So Janeth the Red Flag are indicating those recipes need addition assistance in order to make sure all items are mapped correctly for your sales report. From your recipes page if you Filter By ""Needs Attention"" It will tell you what kind of Addition assistance those items need. ""Need confirmation"" Need ""Recipe or Ingredients"" etc. From there i would open each item and add the item associated with that Recipe/ POS ID. 
	

	Janeth Guzman 11:09:21 am
	
		Could I delete those items that re more that one and just keep the ones that are already entered with all of the information?
	
		Like I have 3 Empire with Cheese and I dont understand how that happened
	

	Peter 11:11:41 am
	
		Im not to sure yet either, Looking for an explanation now. Do you have multiple Empire with cheese buttons in your POS, Potentially different variants or in different menu groups?
	

	Janeth Guzman 11:12:22 am
	
		No just one
	
		So on the POS you click on the burger and then do any add ons or modifications but there is only one
	

	Peter 11:14:45 am
	
		Okay, Let me keep digging and i find the issue shortly
	

	Janeth Guzman 11:15:32 am
	
		sounds good ! Thanks Peter. I am doing other work so I will keep this hat window open
	

	Peter 11:16:15 am
	
		Perfect!

		HI there
	
		I cant login to my account, I always get an error message.
	

	Victoria 04:11:33 pm
	
		Hi Rolf - Thanks for chatting in! 
	
		Hang tight for one moment while I pull up your account 
	

	Rolf Hensche 04:12:00 pm
	
		here is the error Unexpected token < in JSON at position 0
	

	Victoria 04:14:26 pm
	
		After taking a look into your account, it looks like there has been an email sent out to you in regard to billing for this account in particular. Have you had the chance to speak with Rob?
	

	Rolf Hensche 04:15:14 pm
	
		nope, there was a discussion about adding the Food part to it but presently that is too expensive, we are looking at our POS system again but we need to continue with the Beverage part
	
		Still there?
	

	Victoria 04:21:01 pm
	
		Yes, just taking a look to see if we may have sent the email to the wrong address 
	
		I was able to confirm with Rob the correct email address. The email that was sent over to you may have gone to a spam folder if you would like to check in there. After speaking with Rob he has informed me he will be available to talk and go over this in greater detail. 
	

	Rolf Hensche 04:27:46 pm
	
		Well, what is the issue though? I did check the payment setup and all of that seems fine.
	

	Victoria 04:28:11 pm
	
		Do you have some time within the next hour to speak with him? 
	

	Rolf Hensche 04:28:52 pm
	
		Well, I am running a restaurant. What is the issue though? I am a little at a loss here. Happy to talk at some point in the afternoon not during the evening service.
	
		I need to place orders though, and see our inventory information.
	

	Victoria 04:37:29 pm
	
		After speaking with your account manager Rob, he was able to inform me that the issue is in regard to billing. It seems that your account had not been charged, and was locked out for lack of payment.  If you?d like to open the beverage account again today we can charge the card on file the $149/month per your previous agreement.  Please let me know if you'd like to continue with that
	

	Rolf Hensche 04:39:19 pm
	
		I believe this happened simply because BevSpot had promissed us to fix the issue with the inventory system and our POS yet you were never able to make it work. We were told that we would not be charged until the problem was solved. That never happened. Never the less, we need the system to operate even though we cant take advantage of the inventory part. So, please go ahead and charge the card on file.
	
		Obviously unfortunate that BevSpot is not keeping their end of the deal but I guess it is what it is.

		 I am not sure if Rob is aware of this information. Before anything is charged I'm am going to inform him about this. 
	

	Rolf Hensche 04:47:04 pm
	
		Ok, I believe I did discuss this with him. The problem is that BevSpot is not able to map the items from Toast properly to the respective inventory account since we use the Toast size function like many other restaurants do. At the time, we were told BevSpot was working on a solution and payment was to be suspendet until the system was fixed.
	

	Victoria 04:50:39 pm
	
		Ok - that makes sense. I'm going to go ahead and open the account for today and then before anything is charged, Rob will reach out to you to go over payment plans and payment information. 
	

	Rolf Hensche 04:50:41 pm
	
		We obviously went to the entire setup process with the expectation that we would eventually be able to use the system as advertised. If we would have been told that BevSpot was not able to do it we would have gone a different route.
	
		Thank you for at least working with us right now.
	

	Victoria 04:52:45 pm
	
		Oh, most definitely Rolf! Hang tight for one second while I pull up and open your account 
	

	Rolf Hensche 04:52:55 pm
	
		Thank You
	

	Victoria 04:56:20 pm
	
		I'm happy to help. Please try logging in now and let me know if anything still looks off for you

		maintain the inventory by specific soda - pepsi, diet pepsi, mt. dew....
	

	Kendra 08:50:50 am
	
		Hello Judy, yes there is, you just need to add each soda to your recipes section
	
		Once it is added to a new recipe you just have to link it to a POS item.

		Hi Keyur, how can I help
	

	Keyur Joshi 03:28:32 pm
	
		I'm looking at my most recent Cobblestone variance report
	
		Tito's and Barton's Vodka are negative variance by over a full bottle
	
		I double checked all my invoices, orders, counts, and feel they are accurate
	
		Can you check on your end if there's anything weird about the recipes or how I've mapped Tito's and Barton Vodka?
	

	Kendra 03:30:03 pm
	
		Of course! Let me go take a look for you
	
		if you look on the variance report it says you sold 7.84 but used 10.50
	
		that is for the barton's vodka

		You were transferred to Customer Success
	

	Kim Levesque 03:46:24 pm
	
		I am trying to make our inventory more efficient as we only use the invenotry portion of your system. Im wondering if you can tell me with the orders section...will we be able to automatically order from Bevs or will i have to input what we are ordering first in bevs then send it to the suppliers too?
	

	Victoria 03:46:52 pm
	
		Hi Kim - Thank you for chatting in! 
	

	Kim Levesque 03:47:04 pm
	
		also, is bevs able to integrate with quickbooks yet?
	

	Victoria 03:49:13 pm
	
		in regard to the order section, you can most definitely send your orders out through BevSpot as long as the vendor receives orders via text or email. You won't need to enter all the information in once the order comes in, but you will need to go into the order that was placed and mark it delivered when it arrives within the order history section. 
	

	Kim Levesque 03:50:08 pm
	
		we use lightspeed at the register...it says these two programs are integratable...i dont have the time right now, but if i want to integrate that and quickbooks...do you have someone that can help walk me through it?
	

	Victoria 03:52:09 pm
	
		Oh yes, we can definitely have someone meet with you to discuss all of this in greater detail. Would you be able to provide the account you are associated with please 
	

	Kim Levesque 03:52:28 pm
	
		like the user name
	
		?
	

	Victoria 03:52:32 pm
	
		Yes please

		micah@outflowsj.com
	
		he is the manager at the cafe which is owned by a non profit called outflow ministry. I am the bookkeeper and this whole proccess is really inefficient. Ive been tasked to fix it
	

	Victoria 04:00:34 pm
	
		Perfect, I was able to locate your account and find the account manager who is associated. Is cte@outflowsj.com a good email to send information over to? We can send you a link for you to schedule a date and time that works best to sit down and go over all and any questions you have, followed by a walkthrough of the integration process and how it all works. 
	

	Kim Levesque 04:05:34 pm
	
		yes that is a great email address. I would like to sit with someone and figure it out. Thanks. I wlook forward to hearing back about a day that could work for you guys. I am just leaving the office right now, so tomorrow would be great!
	

	Victoria 04:06:56 pm
	
		Perfect! Our team will send over that email and from there you can pick a date and time for tomorrow that works best for you! Keep an eye out for Support@bevspot.com as the email will be going out to you shortly. 
	

	Kim Levesque 04:07:08 pm

	Keyur Joshi 09:51:05 am
	
		Previous variance report
	

	Victoria 09:52:16 am
	
		Hi Keyur, what are you currently looking for in regard to one of your previous variance reports? 
	

	Keyur Joshi 09:52:38 am
	
		I believe there are some technical issues with the countin
	
		The report is using mapping to archived or deleted items
	

	Victoria 09:53:38 am
	
		And is this for your beverage account or Cobblestone OTR? 
	

	Keyur Joshi 09:53:42 am
	
		Yes
	

	Victoria 09:54:21 am
	
		Is this for your beverage account or cobblestone OTR? 
	

	Keyur Joshi 09:54:44 am
	
		Cobblestone
	

	Victoria 09:55:49 am
	
		Ok, hang tight for one moment while I take a look into this account for you. Can you please provide an example of an item that stands out to you within the variance report? 
	

	Keyur Joshi 09:56:18 am
	
		I just fixed 3 mapping status...
	
		Original Sin was mapped to an item that was archived
	
		Is that possible?
	
		I just fixed the mapping to the active item
	
		Tito's & Barton Vodka have been missing more than 1 bottles 6 weeks in a row
	
		And we believe it could be a technical counting issue on Bevspot
	

	Victoria 10:02:18 am
	
		In regard to the mapping of items,  yes you are correct, you can map an item to an archived item within your account. 
	

	Keyur Joshi 10:03:20 am
	
		I see that now
	
		But are there any deeper trouble shooting you can do on Titos and Barton?
	
		I am currently doing daily inventory on a spreadsheet to verify if Bevspot is the issue or if it's actual missing inventory
	

	Victoria 10:07:39 am
	
		In regard to the Tito's and Barton Vodka - I think it would be best if you had the chance to meet with your account manager Nick. There are definitely a few different reasons why this count could be off for you. I will take a look now to see if there's anything that stands out as to why the count would be off but hang tight for a quick moment while I take a look. 
	

	Keyur Joshi 10:07:57 am
	
		Ok
	

	Victoria 10:13:31 am
	
		I don't see any negative usage for those two items in particular so that is a good thing. It appears you have counted and marked your deliveries correctly so what I'm going to do is send you over a link to Nicks calendar, from here you can schedule a date and time that works best for you to get on a call with nick where he can walk through the account with you and take a deeper look into those to specific items. 
	

	Keyur Joshi 10:14:30 am
	
		He usually refers me to support
	
		But sure I can do that
	

	Victoria 10:17:30 am
	
		Actually on that note what I will do for you is, what date and time works best for you to get on a call with someone? 
	

	Keyur Joshi 10:20:37 am
	
		Let me check... let's do next week
	
		I am doing daily inventory on Barton and Tito's
	
		so we will have better data next week
	

	Victoria 10:29:15 am
	
		Ok perfect. One of our support specialists will be in touch with you at the beginning of next week and then from there, you can pick a date and time that works best for you! 
	

	Keyur Joshi 10:29:27 am
	
		Thank you
	

	Victoria 10:34:23 am
	
		Im happy to help!

		BevSpot Support here! How can we help?
	

	Lindsay Gingrich 01:06:19 pm
	
		Hello few questions, I'm trying to figure out why my inventory usage is so off, I keep having negative used items from week to week
	
		also, my inventory periods seem distorted.
	

	Victoria 01:07:37 pm
	
		Hi Lindsay - thanks for chatting in. Hang tight for one moment while I take a look into your account 
	

	Lindsay Gingrich 01:07:50 pm
	
		thank you
	
		still there ?
	

	Victoria 01:19:19 pm
	
		Yes, sorry about that -  After taking a look I noticed the items with negative usage have not been marked for any deliveries or transfers. If you look at the picture below it shows that you started with 8.4 bottles of crown royal vanilla,  you had 0 deliveries and transfers, and then went back in and counted 8.45 causing that .5 negative usage. Then below that crown apple, we have the Flamingo Fruit where we started with five have no deliveries or transfers but then counted a second time and the amount was still 5. In order to get rid of the negative usage on your items, you will need to go into the order history section and record your orders to show when you received the items you are counting within your inventory section.

	Lindsay Gingrich 01:20:27 pm
	
		it seems to not be accounting for my deliveries? are my periods off? like under my most recent inventory, it shows I've gained 70ish black cherry white claws..
	
		I'm' not worried about those tiny negative usages, its those big numbers i dont understand. I have my PMIX here, and im looking at my invoices put in and there must be something wrong with the periods? My week should go from Tuesday to Monday.
	
		did you find those?
	

	Victoria 01:30:25 pm
	
		Yes, you are correct. The order dates will need to fall in line with the dates of your inventory period. It shows on the 25th you counted 84 white claws then received 0 deliveries or transfers and then went back in to count 155 causing that negative 71. This equation will remain true to all the items within your account, big or small. 
	

	Lindsay Gingrich 01:30:49 pm
	
		okay so should I be post dating something?
	
		I take my inventory every Tuesday
	
		So for the week of Tue. May 18-Tuesday May 25th, I did recieve a few orders, so shouldn't that figure in? Also, my inventory period should be Tuesday - Mondays
	

	Victoria 01:37:04 pm
	
		essentially what you will want to do is take your first inventory count, then any and all items you receive for that inventory period, you will want to mark delivered as you have done previously but just verify that the order data falls in between the inventory period you are counting for. The items you received on the 20th will fall into the inventory period of the 18th to the 25th, when you look at your inventory from the 18th to the 25th there is no negative usage for the black cherry white claw. 
	

	Lindsay Gingrich 01:38:17 pm
	
		okay, i guess I""m still confused, due to no orders coming in last week, why my white claw usage is still so off.. I'll just have to go back and check all the periods on both inventories I put in as well as invoices?
	

	Victoria 01:40:37 pm
	
		Ok - within the account you started with 84 white claws and then counted 155 white claws. Once we figure where those extra 71 white claws came from we will be able to get rid of that negative usage. 
	

	Lindsay Gingrich 01:41:00 pm
	
		alright.
	
		also, should my inventory period as well as my order history period be the same days? Inventory is Tuesday - Tuesday and Order is mOnday - Sunday.
	
		I'd like Inventory to say Tuesday - Monday if possible ?

	Lindsay Gingrich 02:03:19 pm
	
		I was just chatting with someone, now when I log in to my most recent inventory and go to order summary, before chatting with this person today, there were all my vendors and I could look at each one, now its one big group
	
		what changed?!
	

	Victoria 02:03:34 pm
	
		Hi Lindsay - you were speaking with me. 
	
		Let me take a look 
	
		If you go to count summary and then select view filters you will be able to select the order you would like to see your items, Vendor being one of them ?
	

	Lindsay Gingrich 02:05:01 pm
	
		this just was not how it was before today
	
		i could log in, go to my most recent invoentory and click on summary and see it all
	
		now it's back
	

	Victoria 02:05:49 pm
	
		What in particular are you not seeing today?
	
		Ok perfect
	

	Lindsay Gingrich 02:06:00 pm
	
		i got real worried! thank you
	

	Victoria 02:06:21 pm
	
		Your very welcome.

		Hi Marguerite! Finalizing my May inventory and looks a little high. Can you please help me?

		Hi Victoria!
	
		Finalizing my May inventory and I think it's a little high. Can you please help me?
	

	Victoria 02:45:30 pm
	
		Hi Theresa! Thanks for chatting in, Hang tight for one moment while I take a look into this for you
	

	Theresa Thompson 02:45:41 pm
	
		Thank you!
	

	Victoria 02:49:30 pm
	
		Alright - so it does look like there's some negative usage but thankfully everything can be corrected! 
	
		https://cdn.livechat-static.com/api/file/lc/att/7006471/bbb719bb4db623024a793400bdc46321/Screen%20Shot%202021-06-14%20at%202.48.51%20PM.png
	
		 Within this screenshot, we see the negative usage to the right, but if we look on the left it just appears that these items were not marked for any deliveries  
	

	Theresa Thompson 02:50:50 pm
	
		hmmm my thought was I may have hit the wrong number for an item
	

	Victoria 02:52:36 pm
	
		In regards to when you were counting? 
	

	Theresa Thompson 02:53:27 pm
	
		Yes. I don't know how to check to see. Thought maybe I hit case instead of bottle
	

	Victoria 02:58:35 pm
	
		Oh no, you counted correctly? - If you are able to look at the screenshot above, the best example is going to be Coors pure. It looks like there was no previous count for that item followed by no deliveries and then there was a count of 26 cans. Currently, BevSpot is unaware of where those 26 cans came from and the same will go for the IPA, Natty's CANS CANS and the Coors Pure Citrus 
	
		If you are able to go into the order history section to mark when those items came in, that negative usage will disappear ?
	

	Theresa Thompson 03:00:28 pm
	
		I haven't ordered any in quite awhile
	
		Are you talking about which vendor?
	

	Victoria 03:02:59 pm
	
		No, regarding your inventory section - it shows that you counted some items but due to the fact that BevSpot doesn't know how they got into your inventory it's giving you that negative usage. 
	
		A good example of an item that has positive usage is the redbridge

	Peter 12:23:48 pm
	
		Hey Frank, Sorry to hear that keeps happening. I very much agree that can be quite frustrating. Let me 
 take a look into your login information to see if i can spot anything out of the ordinary.

I'm going to change your password hopefully for last time and get you squared away. You can login with the same email you have been frank.blasucci@gmail.com and the new password will be BevSpot123 If the problem happens again  i'll will put in a request to our engineering department to further look into it.

	Victoria 12:31:46 pm
	
		Hi Ross - Thanks for chatting in. I was just taking a look at that report and I believe we ran it incorrectly - the variance looked a little high so our backend team is going through the pmix now to fix and re-enter into the account for you?
	

	Ross Molineaux 12:32:54 pm
	
		It was off because my order were scheduled for yesterday but are not coming til today so I changed the received date to today that should fix it
	
		It was accounting for my delivery's I did not receive yet is what i am thinking
	

	Victoria 12:34:12 pm
	
		That sounds like it very well could be the issue, let me relay this information over to my team and ill have that report back in the account for you! 
	
		Hey Ross - We just re-uploaded the report and it looks much better now! You were 100% correct about the orders throwing your variance off!

		Hey Alessandro! looking into your account im seeing one recipe for Negroni. I am also seeing you are integrated with sqaure?it looks like once you have finished 2 inventories  youll be able to run a report through your integration and your pos items should then be in your bevspot account?
	

	Alessandro Bazzu 04:59:36 pm
	
		I thought that I could create items from Bevspot (it's a better system than square since I can create recepies) and they would reflect on square
	
		is this correct?
	

	Erick 05:07:43 pm
	
		Essentially what you will want to do is create your sale items within Square POS System and then once we run a sales report within BevSpot ( from the two inventories that you counted ) we will then be able to link the items within your POS system to the items within your BevSpot account, followed by creating any recipes you may have. This is definitely something we can help walk you through when the time comes to run and link the sale items together within the sales report section of your account.
	

	Alessandro Bazzu 05:10:21 pm
	
		any tutorial available?
	
		thanks for the help btw
	

	Erick 05:16:18 pm
	
		At the moment we do not have a step-by-step on how to map your items. There is a small section within your BevSpot account that reads "" Looking for Help"" in a blue tab to the right-hand side of your page. You can definitely use that as a guide but the best option would be to schedule some time with one of our support specialists. If that is something you are looking to do I can definitely send a link over to you where you can pick a date and time that works best for you to meet and go over this in greater detail.
	

	Alessandro Bazzu 05:19:22 pm
	
		I received an automated email from Ryan Knox that asked me if i wanted to schedule a call with him. I scheduled it for tomorrow
	

	Erick 05:21:51 pm
	
		Oh even better!! Ryan is great! After your meeting with him if you still have any questions or if anything comes up after that, please feel free to reach out to support and we can definitely help you out!
	

	Alessandro Bazzu 05:22:27 pm
	
		Thats great thank you for your help!

		BevSpot Support here! How can we help?
	

	Matt Hart 11:04:12 pm
	
		Hi Annie, one of our venues finalized an inventory, bit I need to add some items. I've added them to our items, bit they are not showing up in the inventory
	

	Annie 11:05:51 pm
	
		Hi Matt, I'd be happy to help you with that!
	
		You can start a new inventory count with the items that you need to add, and copy the items from your previous count into the newest count you have going. After you copy the old count in you can delete the one with the missing items. I can walk you through those steps if you'd like!
	

	Matt Hart 11:07:16 pm
	
		ok thanks
	
		how do I copy the items from the previous inventory?
	

	Annie 11:09:18 pm
	
		Once you've clicked into your new count you'll select the three dots in the upper right hand corner. From there you will select ""Copy Previous Count"". You will have to do this for each storage area. 
	

	Matt Hart 11:11:17 pm
	
		Ok awesome. That's pretty easy
	
		thank you for your help
	

	Annie 11:12:03 pm

		my invoices are not uploading since Wednesday. Are you guys having a problem, or is it just this location?
	

	Victoria 01:54:17 pm
	
		Hi Thomas - Thank you for reaching out. Could you please provide the current location you are speaking about within the Modern Restaurant Group?
	

	Thomas Elwood 01:55:02 pm
	
		El Camino, Fort Lauderdale
	

	Victoria 01:55:58 pm
	
		Thank you for this information. Is this going to be under the account - Food, Beverage, or FOH GOODS? 
	

	Thomas Elwood 01:56:22 pm
	
		BOH food
	

	Victoria 02:03:41 pm
	
		Thank you for this information 
	
		It appears that the invoices have been uploaded into the invoice processing feature. Is there a reason why they were eneted in this particular way instead of manually? 
	

	Thomas Elwood 02:07:16 pm
	
		Because we always have done it this way. We use this feature for the BOH goods.
	

	Victoria 02:15:32 pm
	
		Understood. At the moment I am unable to upload these invoices. I am going to expedite this to our engineering team for them to take a look and get this resolved for you. Is Cheftom60@gmail.com a good email to send account updates to? 
	

	Thomas Elwood 02:15:48 pm
	
		yes
	

	Victoria 02:16:10 pm

	Josh Cruz 12:32:03 pm
	
		Hi Erick, I have an issue with our usage when looking at cart builder
	

	Erick 12:32:27 pm
	
		Hi Josh! what account is this for?
	

	Josh Cruz 12:32:52 pm
	
		This is for our Wanderlustcreamery account
	
		I want to say it's for all our locations
	

	Erick 12:34:55 pm
	
		ok! i will take a look into this now! are they looking off or not showing up?
	

	Josh Cruz 12:35:04 pm
	
		They are way too high
	
		For an item that usually had 0 to 20 in the usage column, now has close to 100
	

	Erick 12:36:19 pm
	
		What item in particular are you looking at?
	

	Josh Cruz 12:36:50 pm
	
		Rose Berry Stracciatella
	
		in our Fairfax location had 120
	
		has*
	
		We haven't used that much in all our stores combined
	

	Erick 12:42:06 pm
	
		Hey josh im still here! just looking in your account!
	

	Josh Cruz 12:42:16 pm
	
		Thank you
	

	Erick 12:59:34 pm
	
		Hey Josh! looking into your account we are not to sure why your usage is so high. I have talked to your account manager Rob and passed this on to engineering. If you could schedule some time with Rob as he will follow up with you  with a solution from our engineering department. Here is a link to schedule https://meetings.hubspot.com/rob854
	

	Josh Cruz 01:00:42 pm
	
		I see. I went ahead and booked the meeting.
	

	Erick 01:01:07 pm
	
		Awesome!! Is there anything else we can help with?!?!
	

	Josh Cruz 01:02:24 pm
	
		There are minor things, like why doesn't the cart builder and other sections have alternating colors for the rows like it does in expected inventory
	
		and does partial inventory not add to our starting count
	

	Erick 01:07:39 pm
	
		That is something i will defiantly send over to our product feedback team! as for your partial inventories no they will not show up in your current inventory count but will be calculated into all your reports?
	

	Josh Cruz 01:08:47 pm
	
		Thank you for that.
	
		Also is there a setting somewhere that allows me to have all my items defaulted to Group by Category and Collapsed?
	

	Erick 01:12:05 pm
	
		Are you talking about in your items page?
	

	Josh Cruz 01:12:43 pm
	
		Yes, Expected Inventory, Cart Builder, etc.
	
		It's a minor thing, but I'd appreciate it if the default for how the page shows up isn't showing all the items expanded and instead organized by category and collapsed.
	

	Erick 01:20:28 pm
	
		So at the moment we cant set how you want your screen to be defaulted, but that is for sure another one i will be sending to our product feedback team!!
	

	Josh Cruz 01:21:42 pm
	
		Okay thanks again. I believe those were all my concerns at the moment.

	Anton 02:25:16 pm
	
		Hello yes, how can I help?
	

	Lindsay Gingrich 02:25:33 pm
	
		In my most recent inventory, it has items archived that were never archived by myself nor anyone else. I'm a bit confused
	
		In some areas, the items with the same code appear fine, then in others the items appear 'blanked' out and archived.
	

	Anton 02:26:11 pm
	
		Give me one minute to pull up you account and take a look.
	

	Lindsay Gingrich 02:26:16 pm
	
		thanks
	

	Anton 02:29:55 pm
	
		I do see there are a number of items that have been archived, let me look into this to see what caused the archiving.
	

	Lindsay Gingrich 02:30:03 pm
	
		thanks.
	
		if you go to say a North Well location, it shows Well Vodka for example as archived in one spot, then available in another. so we're inventorying it, but then when we finalize, it reads as zero
	

	Anton 02:33:00 pm
	
		Which north well location are you looking to? 
	
		Because I see consistency with the items archived in each storage area 
	

	Lindsay Gingrich 02:34:05 pm
	
		go to north well 1
	
		speed well
	

	Anton 02:35:50 pm
	
		Let me reach out to my team, can I reach out to you in a short time?

	Chad Novak 03:42:31 pm
	
		yyes
	

	Erick 03:42:56 pm
	
		Do you know what recipes in particular are missing?
	

	Chad Novak 03:43:36 pm
	
		Fried Cheese Curds, Crispy Fish Tacos among them
	
		These are new menu items that I costed out to determine pricing just recently and the only listings in recipes are the toast entries. I'm thinking they were overwritted??
	
		over-written
	
		or merged and no info from the original recipe carried over?
	
		I checked for them in archived items to no avail
	

	Erick 03:53:19 pm
	
		Hey Chad unfortunately i dont see them showing up in the archived or deleted items. This is interesting because those recipes you originally made should still be in your account even if you create another recipe with the same name. What i can do is reach out to our engineering team to see if maybe they can go in and see what happend and possibly restore this for you!  
	

	Chad Novak 03:56:12 pm
	
		Erick, please reach out. This is extremely frustrating as hours of work are apparently gone. It possible coincides with some update put through which changes a lot of items in inventory. Not the actual item but how they are counted. Things that were counted by the cases were changed to counting individual items
	
		I'm hoping there's a way to restore
	

	Erick 04:00:34 pm
	
		Ok! I will be sure to pass this along! Is chad@fireplaceinn.com the best email to update you at?
	

	Chad Novak 04:00:41 pm
	
		Yes
	

	Erick 04:01:55 pm
	
		Awesome is there anything else i can help with today?
	

	Chad Novak 04:02:58 pm
	
		Just that maybe this can be expedited. I'm trying to keep up with menu pricing due to crazy costs and I really don't have time to recreate all the lost recipes
	

	Erick 04:06:51 pm
	
		100% understand this will definitely be high priority!

		BevSpot Support here! How can we help?
		Hi Jacki how are you today?
	Jacki Bentley 10:23:09 am
		I'm well; how are you?
		I am currently using bevspot for alcohol and food. All of our bar goods are inventoried with food. I am wondering if there is a way to transfer those items for the purpose of recipes or inventory without having to enter the items in both places.
	System 10:27:57 am
		You were transferred to Victoria
	Victoria 10:29:45 am
		Hi Jacki - we can definitely transfer the items from your food account to the beverage - Hang tight for one moment while i pull your account up! 
		after taking a look I just wanted to ask, is there a reason for both food and beverage in the food account?
	Jacki Bentley 10:37:40 am
		The alcohol account is the one I'm concerned with. A lot of the fruit and juices under the food account actually belong in beverages. I would like for them to still be counted with food but need the items available in both places for the purpose of creating more accurate recipes.
		If adding them manually as new items is the best thing, I can do that.
	Victoria 10:48:42 am
		Ok - we can definitely transfer items from your food account to your beverage account. In order to keep an accurate track of your items within the beverage side, you are going to need to count those items twice then due to the fact that you want to count them within the food account also 
		Actually, Jacki. Ignore that! It's too early for me right now ?
		We can absolutely help you transfer your items from the food account to the beverage account without you having to count those products twice. However, as your account currently stands, you only have the transfer ability within your beverage account. For now, I'll turn it on for you for the time being so you can test it out but please expect your account manager to reach out soon to discuss leaving this ability on for you. 
	Jacki Bentley 10:54:56 am
		I'm assuming this would be an additional fee?
	Victoria 10:58:19 am
		That's a conversation that typically happens between you and your account manager. I'm only here to help you with the product and walk you through certain things like these :) I'll let him know to reach out as soon as possible so you can discuss what makes the most sense with him moving forward.
		In the meantime, head to your inventory history tab within your food account and then click ""record transfer"" in the upper-righthand corner. Once you do that, select your beverage account and the particular food items you'd like to transfer, and then you'll be able to see them accumulate within your beverage account (look to inventory history or count summary of your most recent count draft).

	Tom Kriskey 03:58:57 pm
		Hello...I'm wondering, is there a way to add things to multiple vendors in the cart builder, but only send one vendors worth of cart? Does that make sense?
		We order from one vendor multiple times per week and if we add things to other carts, they get sent along with that one vendor when we're not ready to send them.
		hello?
	Erick 04:04:26 pm
		Absolutely. When you build your cart, you can build it for multiple vendors at one time, however, place it for only one if you'd like.
		After you build out your cart in cart builder, once you click into review it, do you see the vendors listed to the right? They should have blue check marks next to them.
	Tom Kriskey 04:05:20 pm
		Duh...you're right. Thank you for the reminder!!!
	Erick 04:05:55 pm
		Select the vendors with carts ready to go and you're all set!
		You got it! Anytime ?

	Miki Hebert 11:20:40 am
		Is there a way I can export my inventory by storage areas into a spreadsheet?
		I do not want it alphabetically
	Victoria 11:22:27 am
		Hi Miki! You sure can.  
		Click into the "" Count Summary"" section of your inventory, then you will select the three dots in the top right hand corner of the page 
		from here you will want to select "" export to excel"" Once you do that at the bottom of the excel file it will show you the different ways to view that export 
		Selecting "" Count Sheet"" in the excel file that was exported will give you each storage area 
	Miki Hebert 11:29:22 am
		when I go to the storage areas it expands my spreadsheet with new columns showing my areas but it does not organize them
	Victoria 11:29:53 am
		Would you be able to provide a screenshot of what you see on your screen. 
		Are you looking to have your items in the exported excel file match the order you would count them in within your inventory?

	Miki Hebert 11:36:42 am
		Yay!
	Victoria 11:36:50 am
		This is the file I receive when selecting the export to excel button in the count summary section of your inventory - When you click into that file do you see 5 tabs at the bottom of the screen?
	Miki Hebert 11:36:50 am
		I don't know how you did it but thank you
		No i only have two
	Victoria 11:38:51 am
		Are the items in the correct order for you from the file I sent over?

Regarding pricing and add-on features to your account, the best way to go about that conversation is to speak with your account manager.

		It's wanting me to copy & paste or upload in a way it's never asked me to do before, and I cant seem to make it cooperate
		A&R Music Bar
	Erick 12:23:11 pm
		So it looks like you are on the new sales reporting  and in order to run your own report you would need to use your integration. 
	Rebecca Lamey 12:24:35 pm
		Is that our only option? Unfortunately we had a POS malfunction and have been using a less than ideal Square set up and A&R doesn't have it's own location just yet.

		ohh ok so what we can do for now is if you could send your pmix file over to Support@bevspot.com we can get your report run for you within 48 hours! Moving forward in order for you to run your own report we would have to get your integration fixed.

	Victoria 10:04:54 am
		Hi Valerie - Regarding the variance report, where are you looking to send it to?
	Valerie  Guzman 10:06:41 am
		well im confused on how to set up the report, and im trying to load it into the system to send over to my boss.
	Victoria 10:09:59 am
		Ok, after taking a look into your account it appears you do not have a direct intagration setup with your account to have these sales reports processed live time. What current POS system are you using? 
	Valerie  Guzman 10:12:09 am
		yes correct we use focus. when i spoke to someone they mentioned something about a uploading a pmix
	Victoria 10:12:55 am
		Yes, you are heading in the right direction - Are you able to log into your POS system and download a PMIX? 
	Valerie  Guzman 10:15:51 am
		so i had loved in the other day and sent myself the weekly report. So, I do have the items that were sold and however many were sold. I uploaded it as a spread sheet onto my computer. Just not sure how to set up the categories once i upload the pmix
		logged*
	Victoria 10:21:00 am
		Ok - no worries at all. Would you be able to send over a copy of your weekly sales within this chat? 
	Valerie  Guzman 10:22:20 am
		well i have several weeks worth of reports to send over, and they want me to do them separately.
		how do you want me to send it? i have it as a spread sheet at the moment.
		https://cdn.livechat-static.com/api/file/lc/att/7006471/843560b756dafc42260fcd3f959ddd45/6_17-%206_20%20bar%20.xlsx
		i just sent over an attachment
	Victoria 10:25:34 am
		Perfect! I was just going to ask about that. It appears within your account you have reports that will need to be processed for the dates of July 11th to the 18th and then July 18th to the 26th. We will want to make sure these dates match up with the dates of your sales file that you pulled from your pos system. 
		Thank you for that 
		I will take a look now - hang tight for one moment 
	Valerie  Guzman 10:27:01 am
		okay thank you!
	Victoria 10:32:14 am
		I'm happy to help! It appears collum E will be your "" Units Sold"", collum D will stand for the "" price "" and then you will use the name of the item as your POS_ID as well. This will get a little confusing to explain over chat on how to convert this information but if you would like to send your weekly sales reports from your POS system over to Support@bevspot.com our team can run the reports for you and have them processed within your account - we can also add in the notes section to send a copy to your boss after every report is processed if that's something that would work for you 
		If not, we can always book some time for you to meet with a support specialist and have them walk you through the process of how to convert your sales report to be able to run it through your account on your own. Whatever works best for you. 
	Valerie  Guzman 10:39:04 am
		well I originally had a scheduled meeting today with someone but they were a no show. If i send over the reports to you guys when will they be put into the website?
		also thank you so much for your time i really appreciate it.
	Victoria 10:42:05 am
		Oh no! I am so sorry to hear about that. Do you by chance remember the name of the person you were supposed to meet with today? I will take a look at our team to see what happened there. We usually have the reports out within 24 hours after they have been sent over to us but I can run the reports live time today for you if that helps! 
	Valerie  Guzman 10:45:44 am
		Andrew I believe, and yes if you can do that that would be a tremendous help! and that can give me time to reschedule something as well.
	Victoria 10:48:11 am
		Ok - I will be forwarding a copy of this chat over to Andrew once we take care of these reports for you so that way we can figure out why he did not show today for your meeting. Moving forward when you send the pmix from your pos system to yourself, feel free to cc Support@BevSpot.com and they will show up in our system for our team to convert and run properly. Right now it looks like there is two weeks' worth of reports that need to be run, does that sound accurate? 
	Valerie  Guzman 10:54:04 am
		okay thank you. also it seems like theres two weeks because i tried to send reports the other day but i was not sure if i was doing it correctly. so i went back and deleted the ones i did. up to the date the other person stopped doing them.
		i have all of the spread sheets  saved by start date and end date. of inventory week as well if that helps
	Victoria 10:57:48 am
		Ok perfect! A good rule of thumb will be to make sure your weekly sales match up with the inventory dates that live within your account. If you can send over the pmix weekly sales to Support@BevSpot.com we will get these reports processed for you in no time! ?
	Valerie  Guzman 10:59:49 am
		okay perfect! do i send all  of them over to you here off this chat? or should i send them all to this email right now?
	Victoria 11:00:30 am
		You can send them here today but moving forward it will be to the email above ?

	Erick 01:08:00 pm
		Ok! ya we can for sure do this! so when you are in your inventory count you should be able to see a list of your storage areas on the left, lets click into the count summary at the top, Then just to the right of your storage areas toward the top of the page you should see an option to view filters and group by category! Let's click ""Category"" and then you can then collapse all and see your totals split by category!
		Let me know if you have any issues!
	Jonathan Almodovar 01:15:19 pm
		thank you kindly!

		Hi Victoria.  I'm having problems with my invoices processing.
		I have 9 that were entered last week that still haven't gone through.  I had a similar problem last month.  I spoke to Anton and he said there was some sort of error that occurred but he thought it was fixed.
	Victoria 12:44:38 pm
		Hi Charlie - Thank you for chatting in. invoice processing is a little wonky at times but hang tight for one moment while I take a look into your account 
		After reaching out to your account manager he has informed me that they are still working to process these invoices and it should be all set by no later than Tuesday of next week. If you come back in on Tuesday and they are still not processed please book some time within your account managers calendar to discuss and go over this in greater detail ? https://app.hubspot.com/meetings/nick554

		Hi, i think we got disconnected
		I was wondering why my inventory is not showing the negative inventory. please let me know, thanks!
	Dan 10:42:57 am
		Hi Kelly,  yes it looks like we did get disconnected there. To answer your question, there was a product update that went into effect last week, which moved the usage to a hover. If you put your cursor on the value for each item in your count summary page, usage will appear in a box
	Kelly Lundquist 10:44:09 am
		okay, ill see if that works
		So the negative inventory is gone its just showing me what i had for inventory last week when i hover over it
	Dan 10:47:18 am
		Okay, which items were you looking at that had the negative inventory? 
	Kelly Lundquist 10:53:47 am
		i dont know what they are it says 19 items
		actually now im seeing the negative!

	Thomas Casabona 02:42:47 pm
		hi
		for some reason when i am going to do an order, my inventory doesnt show the usage column like it normally does
	Dan 02:45:01 pm
		Hi Thomas, yes that is correct. The software went through an update last week and the usage has moved to a hover. So if you are at the count summary page and you move your cursor over ""value"" for each item, a box will appear with your usage calculation
	Thomas Casabona 02:46:04 pm
		oh no
	Dan 02:46:11 pm
		Are you able to see it?
	Thomas Casabona 02:46:24 pm
		yes...thats a disaster though
		thats the only option??
	Dan 02:47:34 pm
		That is what it will look like for the current count. If you look at a previous count, the column changes to usage
		Click the spot check button at the top right of the count summary page
	Thomas Casabona 02:48:48 pm
		i only need todays inventory to show me what our usage was for last week as i build a new cart
		the previous weeks i dont need
	Dan 02:50:40 pm
		You should still be able to see usage on the cart builder page when you go to fill out an order
		Let me know if it is not showing up there
	Thomas Casabona 02:51:03 pm
		its not  ive never seen it there
		it shows sku, unit, price, inventory, par, cart qty
	Dan 02:51:38 pm
		Got it
		there is a button top left next to ""Latest Finalized"", you can change the view to weekly usage
		it is a dropdown menu
	Thomas Casabona 02:52:40 pm
		right
		but i want to see the pars too
		but i get it  not much can be done.   hopefully there are complaints and it goes back to the old version
	Dan 02:53:42 pm
		I understand. You would like to see par levels and weekly usage on the same cart builder page?
	Thomas Casabona 02:53:50 pm
		no
		just the way it used to be
		so i can see both at the same time
		i guess it would be fine on the cart builder page too
	Dan 02:56:44 pm
		Absolutely. I am sorry the new layout is presenting some challenges, I will take your feedback to the team and see if this is something that can be implemented
		Is there anything else you need help with today Thomas?
	Thomas Casabona 02:57:34 pm
		thats it   thanks for your help

		Ya so when you go into your cart you should see all your vendors to the right under ""Review Order."" You can deselect your orders you order by phone and bevspot will save them for later! you can then go in and review your orders you order by Email like normal. After you have ordered those products you can click back into your cart and you will see all the deselected orders that were saved from earlier. From here you can go in and select the vendors you order from on the phone then click ""Review Order"" and then ""Record Order"" Instead of ""Place New Order""

	Juan Fernandez 11:05:03 am
		hello
		I would like to ask if is a way to place an order
		and don't send it to the supplier
	Victoria 11:06:48 am
		Hi Juan - you most definitely can do that! Simply go through your cart builder section like you normally would but when you get to the very last step, instead of clicking "" place order"" you'll want to select "" record order""
	Juan Fernandez 11:07:12 am
		ok
		that would work for to much invoices that we never place in the system
		thanks
	Victoria 11:11:11 am
		No problem! If you have an invoice that needs to be entered into the system that you didn't place through bevspot feel free to go into the "" Orders"" tab and select "" History"". At the top of the page, you'll see a section that reads "" record invoice"" once you select that you can enter in the proper information that pertains to that invoice.

		yes
	Erick 01:43:51 pm
		Are you manually entering these items into Bevspot from a physical invoice on hand?
	Juan Fernandez 01:44:31 pm
		i would say yes
		I'm working on to mach the PO with the actual physical invoice ( to match what was ordered and what actually received
	Erick 01:48:53 pm
		Ok, perfect - simply take a picture of the invoice you have on hand and attach the file to the invoice you're looking to cross-reference. Once you do that the invoice will be uploaded into the account for you to verify that everything you ordered and manually entered in is correct
		You will still need to physically enter the items you received into bevspot but uploading a picture file will allow you to see what was on the physical invoice
	Juan Fernandez 01:50:30 pm
		ok

		Hi from BevSpot Support! Check out our help center at www.bevspot.com/help or chat us here if you have any questions as you move around the software.
	Kit 10:32:17 am
		Hello! I very recently joined BevSpot as a Lightspeed Restaurant POS user and I'm a little lost on how the integration works. How are the items in my POS linked to BevSpot for inventory tracking?
	Dan 10:33:12 am
		Hi Kit, welcome to BevSpot and thanks for chatting in! May I have the name of your restaurant so I can take a look at your account? 
	Kit 10:33:29 am
		The Barb and Olive
	Dan 10:33:54 am
		Awesome, give me one minute
		Hi Kit, so it looks like since you just joined BevSpot your account is still in the trial phase. I do not see any specific plan selected. With the Standard Plan, your Lightspeed POS integration would be included since that is one of BevSpot's preferred partners. 
	Kit 10:40:40 am
		Oh ok, to be fair I haven't even done onboarding yet. Sorry for being impatient! I'll wait
	Dan 10:41:31 am
		Oh no worries at all! Thanks for reaching out to get clarity. The way the integration works is by mapping your items by their POS ID in Lightspeed and then matching that to the inventory cycle you run
	Kit 10:41:51 am
		thats makes total sense and answers my question
	Dan 10:42:08 am
		Awesome! Anything else you need some help on today Kit?
	Kit 10:42:32 am
		no i'm all set! have a good one dan :)
	Dan 10:43:16 am
		You as well. Don't hesitate to reach out in the future if you have more questions

		BevSpot Support here! How can we help?
	Daniel Castaneda 01:09:42 pm
		Hi Dan, this is Dan, from Lalo's in Berwyn, IL
	Dan 01:10:21 pm
		Nice to chat with you Dan, what can I assist you with today?
	Daniel Castaneda 01:11:12 pm
		I have two questions.  I had a problem registering a vendor invoice yesterday and was wondering if you can help me...
		..I received an errore message..
	Dan 01:12:42 pm
		Absolutely. Was this vendor invoice for an order that you were about to place or were you trying to finalize an invoice for product that had been delivered?
	Daniel Castaneda 01:13:22 pm
		Product was already delivered.  Lalo's Berwyn, BevSpot Food....
		Meat Purveyor.  I basically want to change the weight and price/lb of the item, but it won't let me...
	Dan 01:14:52 pm
		Got it, and which vendor and date is this invoice for. I will take a look at it
	Daniel Castaneda 01:15:33 pm
		..I deleted it.  Let me try to register again so that you can take a look...
	Dan 01:16:16 pm
		Sounds good! take your time
	Daniel Castaneda 01:20:27 pm
		ok.  Purveyor=Amigos Meat.  Date=08/12
	Dan 01:22:53 pm
		Awesome. I see the invoice and clicked in. You want to change the weight and unit price for all the items or just 1 or two?
	Daniel Castaneda 01:24:11 pm
		..all of em'.  Try changing the weight of ITEM 620620 to 76.10 to see if you get the error message..
	Dan 01:25:30 pm
		if you are looking at the invoice page
		refresh it 
	Daniel Castaneda 01:26:34 pm
		..stand by..
	Dan 01:28:59 pm
		It looks to have been changed on my end
	Daniel Castaneda 01:29:14 pm
		ok.  That one is changed.  Try next one.
		M93285...weight=187.10
	Dan 01:31:09 pm
		Okay I changed that one, let me know if you see it after refreshing the page
	Daniel Castaneda 01:33:06 pm
		Ok.  Fixed!! Thanks!! Do you think the bug is specific to those ITEMS?
	Dan 01:35:03 pm
		Great to hear! I don't think the bug is specific to those items. Sometimes the software will act funny like this. As an added note though, after you change all of the weights and everything looks good to you, make sure you go up to the top right of your screen and hit the ""confirm and save"" button. I did that just now after changing everything, so maybe that was the issue
	Daniel Castaneda 01:36:13 pm
		Ok. I was able to process other invoices yesterday with no problem.  I then came back to this invoice and the problem persisted....all fixed.  Thanks!!!
		Now.....2nd issue.
		Billing.  Do I have an outstanding balance?  Our CORP card is not expired...
	Dan 01:38:30 pm
		Awesome! glad that we got it figured out
		Give me one minute to look into billing
		I see you have a Mastercard on file ending in 2512 with an invoice for $200 that was just paid on August 8. Your next payment date looks like September 8 for $200. I do not see anything outstanding
	Daniel Castaneda 01:42:53 pm
		Great!! Thanks for checking.  Appreciate all your help!!?
	Dan 01:43:54 pm
		My pleasure Dan. Have a great day and always feel free to let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

		We have two vendors that have combined into one vendor instead of being separated.
		What is the best way to change all the vendors so they are just under one name instead of three different names?
	Erick 01:25:47 pm
		Hi Michael - We can for sure do this! In order to do this you should go to the orders dropdown then click ""Vendors""  we can then add the new vendor with the correct email/Phone number. Lastly your going to go into your items page where you can sort your items by vendor and bulk edit those 3 vendors to change them to the new vendor
	Michael Thompson 01:29:05 pm
		I'm a little confused on the bulk edit part
	Erick 01:30:16 pm
		ok! have you gone in and created the new vendor?

	Ocean Prime Naples 04:00:51 pm
		Hello, I finalized the 2nd count of inventory and have some questions to find my variance/usage of products on hand.
		How do I see the number of products used/rang in on our Aloha terminals, and compare it with our starting and ending count for our inventories?
	Marguerite 04:02:34 pm
		Hi! I can absolutely help you with this.  
		What's your name? 
	Ocean Prime Naples 04:02:56 pm
		Apologies my name is Donald
	Marguerite 04:03:43 pm
		Hi Donald! To compare your usage data with your sales data for the purpose of finding your variance, I'm going to walk you through a few simple steps. Sound good? 
	Ocean Prime Naples 04:04:03 pm
		Perfect, I am following
	Marguerite 04:04:37 pm
		Great. On the right hand side of your account, do you see the ""Sales"" button? 
	Ocean Prime Naples 04:05:24 pm
		Do you mean on the left side menu drop down?
	Marguerite 04:05:31 pm
		I do! Whoops. Mondays... 
	Ocean Prime Naples 04:05:53 pm
		All good did not see anything on the left hand side.
	Marguerite 04:06:29 pm
		But once you press, ""Sales,"" then press, ""Run New Report.""
	Ocean Prime Naples 04:07:23 pm
		Okay, I am on that page and currently see I am on step 2 0f 3.
	Marguerite 04:07:36 pm
		Awesome - almost there! 
		Now, fill in the starting inventory and ending inventory dates (you can plug in any inventory dates you want to). Most customers like to see this data on a weekly cadence but we also have some customers who run it monthly. 
		For your case, just plug in the only two inventories you have. 
	Ocean Prime Naples 04:09:40 pm
		It says Bevspot is currently processing your POS data
		It will not let me proceed
	Marguerite 04:10:40 pm
		Ahhh... got ya. That's because your inventory from today is finalized for the future (435pm) and BevSpot isn't able to understand that. Easy fix though! 
		Let's go back into your inventory count from today and make that quick fix. Let me know when you're in there!
	Ocean Prime Naples 04:11:53 pm
		I am here
		I see how to adjust the time.
	Marguerite 04:12:33 pm
		Great! 
		Yep! Just those upper three dots in the right hand corner and then, ""Edit Count Info."" Just make sure it's marked for a time on or before 4:13pm. 
	Ocean Prime Naples 04:14:55 pm
		I believe that is all I needed appreciate the help!
	Marguerite 04:14:59 pm
		You got it! 
		If you need anything else, feel free to chat back in, email support@bevspot.com or get in touch with your account manager, Brian (brian@bevspot.com). 
	Ocean Prime Naples 04:19:10 pm
		is there a way to get the ending count on the Variance analysis report?
	Marguerite 04:20:48 pm
		If you hover over the usage data, your beginning, deliveries and ending count will pop up.

These 29 items give or take will be accounted for just as they would through invoice processing but by you going into "" record invoice"" it will eliminate the step of waiting for the third party machine to process it and you will not need to go back into the account, later on, to check that the items match correctly to the items in your account.

		Every time? No ...
	Dan 01:59:09 pm
		I understand. We can still try to process the invoice for you, but just as a heads up, we are trying to steer our clients away from invoice processing going forward because it is not always as accurate as just manually checking the invoice.
		Did you need help with anything else today or just this invoice?
	Mario Regalado 01:59:53 pm
		Well if that is the case we will probably move away from BevSpot as well.

		You left the following comment: Invoices not processing said to start inputting them manually that you are moving away from invoice processing. This is one of the features that we use Bevspot. If this is the case we will likely move on to a different system.

		Hi - question about inputting product that has been delivered
		If the order was not placed thru BevSpot from a vendor, how can I still go back and mark that I have received product from that vendor anyway?

		Hi Victoria, I was hoping you could give me some details/info on integration with toast POS. I have it setup on toast side but am wondering the details pertaining to the menu setup and whatnot
	Victoria 01:18:08 pm
		Hi Rebekkah - thanks for chatting in! Currently, if you have a toast log in, you can go into the "" Settings"" section of your account and then select "" integrations"" from here you will see a symbol that prompts you to "" connect"". Clicking on that will give you the step by step on how to add your POS login to your BevSpot account and then once you have that done we can have you set up a call with your account manager, to go over how to run the reports and read the data that is pulling from that integration. 
		Sorry about this - taking a look into your account now, your integration is already connected! 
	Rebekkah Damiani 01:19:57 pm
		I?m not sure who my account manager is with BevSpot. Can you set me up with someone? I am currently connected with toast
		I just completed the connecting this afternoon
	Victoria 01:21:22 pm
		Awesome! We can definitely send over a link to your account manager's calendar and you can select a date and time that works best for you to meet and discuss all the data and reporting that comes along with the toast integration.

		I appreciate your help today!

		hi
		i would like to import invoices
		can you activate the addon?
	Victoria 12:56:14 pm
		Hello -  Thank you for reaching out! Are you referring to invoice processing? 
	Bistro Tohu 12:56:25 pm
		i guess
		i want to import csv and pdf  for creating items
	Victoria 01:02:13 pm
		Ok... Just to clarify, these are going to be invoiced from a vendor, and that's what you're looking to enter into the account? Or do you have a list of items on a file that we can upload through the items section? Just double-checking because currently, invoice processing is an add-on feature that is not included within the freemium program.
	Bistro Tohu 01:02:55 pm
		from invoice
		i m ok to pay
	Victoria 01:04:12 pm
		Ok, thank you for this information. Hang tight for a quick moment while I reach out to your account manager. 
	Bistro Tohu 01:04:52 pm
		thx
	Victoria 01:07:14 pm
		Just spoke with your account manager, Marguerite. She thinks it?s best to start you guys in our Standard Program which will allow for invoice processing. That will be $119 per month, billed annually. With that, will come initial inventory and ordering training for you and your colleagues, COGS reporting, excess and unused reporting, accounting exports, unlimited historical data, and access to our support team.
	Bistro Tohu 01:08:03 pm
		haha no way
		i just have a couple of invoice to import
		so the 1.50$ per invoice is enough
	Victoria 01:11:47 pm
		Ok, no worries at all. I currently do not have access to turn that feature on for you, please feel free to reach out to your account manager Marguerite at marguerite@bevspot.com and she will be able to assist you on what the best next step will be to access that feature.
